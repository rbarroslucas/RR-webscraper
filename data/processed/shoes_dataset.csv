In our tests in the lab, we really liked its foot-shaped design, combined with the authentic zero-drop running experience Altra is known for. On the flip side, we think that the foam could have a bit more energy return, and it's not the shoe for rugged trails or high-speed runs. All in all, we think that the Outroad 2 is a solid choice for those seeking a versatile, budget-friendly hybrid shoe that doesn't sacrifice comfort for performance.","Top pick in best zero drop running shoes (2023), Top pick in best Altra running shoes (2023)","76 / 100 from 1,585 users | 87 / 100 from 6 experts","Dec 13, 2023",Trail,Neutral,Hiking,Men: 10.1 oz / 286g | Women: 8.6 oz / 243g,0 mm,27.5 mm,79 Good!,$120,,Neutral,"10.3 oz / 291g, 10.1 oz / 286g","1.4 mm, 0.0 mm",Mid/forefoot,Slightly small,Balanced,Small,Bad,Decent,Good,Moderate,Medium,Wide,Moderate,Normal,Moderate,Moderate,,"25.5 mm, 27.5 mm",Normal,✓,All seasons,✓,#505,Bottom 9%,#410,Bottom 26%,,,,Light,2.2 mm,"26.9 mm, 27.5 mm",,

In our tests, we were impressed with its performance on long runs and easy days. And despite its substantial size, it's still surprisingly lightweight. The upper is really comfortable and it's well-ventilated, though it does fall short in durability and lacks a gusseted tongue. However, these are minor quibbles in what we found to be an excellent, fairly-priced maximalist option from Brooks, capable of devouring miles with ease.","Top pick in best Brooks walking shoes (2024), Top 6% in road running shoes, Top 2% in Brooks running shoes, Top 4% most popular running shoes","93 / 100 from 70,650 users | 89 / 100 from 28 experts","Jan 15, 2024 - updated May 21, 2025",Road,Neutral,"Jogging |, Treadmill |, Walking |, All-day wear",Men: 10.1 oz / 286g | Women: 9 oz / 255g,6 mm,32 mm,91 Superb!,$150,Daily running,Neutral,"10.3 oz / 291g, 10.1 oz / 286g","9.5 mm, 6.0 mm","Heel, Mid/forefoot",True to size,Soft,Big,Bad,Good,Good,Moderate,Narrow,Medium,Moderate,Small,Stiff,Stiff,"39.8 mm, 38.0 mm","30.3 mm, 32.0 mm","Normal, Wide, X-Wide",✓,All seasons,✓,#27,Top 5%,#22,Top 4%,✓,,,,,,,

However, in our experience, it lands in a middle ground. While it maintains the same stability, grip, and cushioning as the non-waterproof version, the addition of Gore-Tex makes the shoe noticeably heavier and less agile. But for those seeking a comfortable, waterproof, and surprisingly breathable trail running shoe, the Speedgoat 5 GTX stands out as a top choice. We really liked its balanced approach, and for runners prioritizing comfort and all-weather readiness, this Hoka could be the go-to option.","Top pick in best waterproof running shoes (2023), Top pick in best waterproof trail running shoes (2023)","83 / 100 from 3,068 users | 87 / 100 from 4 experts","Dec 16, 2023",Trail,Neutral,Hiking,11.5 oz / 326g,4 mm,,82 Good!,$170,,Neutral,"11.3 oz / 319g, 11.5 oz / 326g","7.0 mm, 4.0 mm",Mid/forefoot,True to size,Soft,Big,Good,Good,Decent,Moderate,Medium,Medium,Moderate,Small,Stiff,Moderate,,27.6 mm,Normal,✓,Winter,✓,#462,Bottom 17%,#304,Bottom 45%,,,,Moderate,3.5 mm,34.6 mm,✗,Waterproof
