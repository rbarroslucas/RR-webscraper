  "RR_verdict": "For us, the ASICS GT 2000 13 is the Toyota Corolla of running shoes—it's always reliable but seldom delivers a thrilling experience. We found it masterfully combines stability, durability, comfort, and value, setting a benchmark few other brands can match. And despite minor issues like the redesigned tongue padding, this is the best GT 2000 yet!",
