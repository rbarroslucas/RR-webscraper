  "RR_verdict": "We are a little unclear on whether the Cloudswift is a running shoe, a gym trainer, or just a sexy sneaker. But we did find this On shoe to be exceptionally durable, grippy, and protective. It delivers unrivaled impact absorption in each step! If you want a daily trainer that will handle your slow, short runs and gym sessions with ease and style, we say pick the Cloudswift!",
