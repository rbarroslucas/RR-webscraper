  "pros": "Truly waterproof; Exceptional build quality; Winter-ready; Amazing reflective details for nighttime safety; Looks cool and it's comfy for daily wear; Provides good traction in wet conditions; Light and flexible",
  "cons": "Lacks breathability; Low-volume toebox; Insufficient stability",
  "RR_verdict": "The On Cloud Waterproof offers an exceptional experience in cold, wet conditions, with top-notch build quality and ample reflective details for safety. However, in our testing, we found its firm midsole and limited stability make it less ideal for running. Its upper also lacks breathability, making it unsuitable for warmer days. Based on our experience, it's a unique, high-quality shoe ideal for cool, wet conditions, but you'll need an alternative for running or walking in warmer weather.",
