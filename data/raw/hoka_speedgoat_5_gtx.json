  "brand": "HOKA",
  "total_score": "82",
  "pros": "Plush, cushioned midsole; Exceptional stability; Remarkable breathability for a Gore-Tex shoe; Spacious enough for most foot types; Well-suited for ultra marathons; Superior grip on easy and moderate trails; Vibram Megagrip outsole; Utilizes recycled materials in the upper",
  "cons": "Simply too heavy; Midsole hardens noticeably in cold temperatures; Could benefit from increased flexibility",
  "RR_verdict": "The Hoka Speedgoat 5 GTX aims to retain the strengths of its regular version while adding a waterproof membrane. However, in our experience, it lands in a middle ground. While it maintains the same stability, grip, and cushioning as the non-waterproof version, the addition of Gore-Tex makes the shoe noticeably heavier and less agile. But for those seeking a comfortable, waterproof, and surprisingly breathable trail running shoe, the Speedgoat 5 GTX stands out as a top choice. We really liked its balanced approach, and for runners prioritizing comfort and all-weather readiness, this Hoka could be the go-to option.",
