  "pros": "Enhanced overall comfort; PureGEL technology for softer landings; Increased cushioning; Cozier feel; Durable outsole; Ready for long runs; Doubles for walking or gym sessions; Enhanced for heel strikers; Reasonable weight",
  "cons": "Price increase; Still lacks energy return; Breathability downgrade",
  "RR_verdict": "We found that the ASICS GT 1000 13 excels in a fiercely competitive value-oriented market, despite a minor price hike to $110. Sure, we weren't thrilled with the $10 increase, yet the improvements—enhanced cushioning, better stability, and the introduction of PureGEL technology—made it a worthwhile upgrade. Although the energy return is on the lower end and the updated upper slightly reduces breathability, this mild stability shoe remains a top choice for runners seeking an affordable yet reliable option.",
