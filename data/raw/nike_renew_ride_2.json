  "RR_verdict": "The Nike Renew Ride 2 is another budget shoe to enter the market, which is a very difficult area to lead in because of the lack of features these shoes have. The Renew Ride 2 wins my love when it comes to its midsole though. Upon donning the pair on wear tests, I understood why Nike’s incredible React Foam is one of the runners' favorite midsole constructions, especially considering the price of the shoe.",
