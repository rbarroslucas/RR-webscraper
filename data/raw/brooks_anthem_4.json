  "pros": "Affordable; Light and nimble; Runs cool; True to size; No hot spots or rubbing",
  "cons": "Uninspiring ride; Not responsive",
  "RR_verdict": "As a shoe that entices runners on a budget, I found that the Brooks Anthem 4 offers nothing but lightness and comfort! It's a simple, no-fuss running shoe that's generic, as I found that it works for most types of runs - recovery runs, easy long runs, and 5Ks. Just don't expect it to wow you because it's not cut out for performance-oriented running.",
