  "pros": "Superb Vibram outsole; Exceptionally plush ride; Remarkably flexible; Luxuriously-soft Fresh Foam X; Reasonably priced; Excellent for winter; Rare sustainable features; Reliable grip on moderate trails; Doubles as a great hiking shoe",
  "cons": "Poor ventilation; Problematic non-gusseted tongue; Durability concerns in toebox and heel; Not suited for technical trails",
  "RR_verdict": "We really liked the New Balance Fresh Foam X Hierro v8 for its versatility on the trails—it's great for many different outdoor activities. Though it has a few drawbacks like a disappointing tongue and some issues with breathability, if you're okay with that, we think you'll enjoy its super comfy ride and durable-yet-grippy Vibram outsole. Overall, we think it's a great upgrade in the Hierro series!",
