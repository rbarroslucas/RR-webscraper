  "brand": "Adidas",
  "total_score": "85",
  "pros": "Really stable; Enhanced upper durability; Reduced weight from v1; Unique aesthetics; Competitively priced; Flexible and comfortable for walking; Nice heel lockdown; Cheaper than most On models!; Big reflective elements",
  "cons": "Limited responsiveness; Fast-wearing, rock-catching outsole; Could be more breathable; Lacks vertical room in upper",
  "RR_verdict": "The Switch FWD 2 from Adidas continues to grab attention as an eye-catching shoe, and we believe it's a solid choice for casual runners seeking ample cushioning coupled with a high drop. The shoe retains its bold, maximalist design, offering substantial stack height but with a lighter, more agile feel. However, our lab tests revealed a noticeable decline in outsole durability, which is concerning. Additionally, the midsole still lacks the responsive energy return we critiqued in the first edition, a key flaw Adidas has yet to address, leaving us hopeful for future improvements.",
