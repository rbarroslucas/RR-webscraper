  "cons": "Heavier than v1; Still lacks race-day vibe",
  "RR_verdict": "The Puma Deviate Nitro Elite 2 has shown us it's not only a good racing shoe but also a standout for tempo runs. We think that this is a well-thought-out redesign from the first version, featuring an enhanced, comfortable upper and substantial PumaGrip rubber on the outsole that gave us excellent traction and durability. Regrettably, we encountered a slight increase in weight as the main trade-off.",
