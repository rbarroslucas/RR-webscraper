  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "More ZoomX bouncy foam!; Vibram Megagrip outsole; Spacious upper; Exceptional durability; Superb wet condition traction; Ideal for midfoot and forefoot strikers; Ready for long-distance running; Suitable for hiking too",
  "cons": "Could be lighter; Not ideal for heel strikers",
  "RR_verdict": "The Nike Zegama 2 is a highly anticipated update that we feel completely outshines the original model. It finally features a Vibram Megagrip outsole, enhanced with more ZoomX plush foam, and an upgraded upper that offers excellent ventilation and durability. Despite its weight and the higher price tag of $180, we think it's definitely one of the best trail shoes in the market right now.",
