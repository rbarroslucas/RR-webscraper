  "RR_verdict": "As per our observations, the iconic Ultraboost line by Adidas has long been co-opted by the masses as more of a sneaker than a running shoe. However, we found that the 23rd shoe in the series, the Ultraboost Light, marks a return to its roots with an updated midsole that made our daily runs feel as comfortable as our walks around town.",
