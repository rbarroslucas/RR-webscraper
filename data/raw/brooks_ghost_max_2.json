  "brand": "Brooks",
  "total_score": "85",
  "pros": "Improved energy return; Fantastic value; Great durability; Breathable upper; Doubles as a walking shoe; Excels at easy paces; Superior stability; Ready for long runs",
  "cons": "Would benefit from softer foam; Clunky for heel strikers; A bit heavy; Non-gusseted tongue",
  "RR_verdict": "In our view, the Brooks Ghost Max 2 is a mixed bag—offering impressive stability and enhanced energy return, yet let down by its firmer midsole and heavier build. Despite these drawbacks, its attractive price point makes it an excellent choice for beginners or casual joggers seeking a dependable, maximalist running shoe that won't strain the wallet.",
