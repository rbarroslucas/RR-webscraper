  "total_score": "83",
  "pros": "Very stable for being a high-stack shoe; Excellent grip; Breathable upper; Versatile for different workouts; Protective underfoot; Extremely durable outsole; Made with recycled materials; Attractive design",
  "cons": "Definitely stiff and firm; Long breaking-in period",
  "RR_verdict": "The Adidas Adizero Boston line saw a radical change with version number 10 when it got much bigger. As per our observations, the 11th iteration sees just a few differences and remains a maximal training shoe devoted to those runners who love a very firm ride and train for medium to long-distance races. We found it to be surprisingly stable, lighter, and much more durable. And thumbs up for including some recycled materials.",
