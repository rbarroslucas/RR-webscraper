  "brand": "PUMA",
  "total_score": "82",
  "pros": "World-class PUMAGRIP outsole; Durable and comfortable upper, perfect for winter; Surprisingly stable despite its height; Energetic ride due to the Nitro foam; Fantastic at gravel paths and dirt roads; A fantastic all-rounder; Can handle long runs",
  "cons": "Not suitable for summer running; Could benefit from being slightly lighter; The heel counter could be more durable; Only for low-volume feet",
  "RR_verdict": "The Puma Magnify Nitro 2 steps up as a formidable shoe, boasting an energetic ride at a reasonable price. Based on our lab tests, its knit upper might not be the best pick for hot weather runs, and it carries a bit more weight than some of its competitors. Yet, for the majority of runners, it excels in essential qualities expected from a reliable workhorse, and we were really impressed with its exceptional PUMAGRIP outsole, making it a wonderful daily trainer for running in wet conditions or dirt roads.",
