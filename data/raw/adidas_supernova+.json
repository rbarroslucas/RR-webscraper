  "RR_verdict": "The Adidas Supernova+ is a less cushioned shoe with neutral support. Made of durable recycled materials, this shoe enticed me because it’s ecologically conscious as well as functional. I recommend it to anyone of average-to-light weight as a training shoe for a road race. It may not suit heavy strikers who typically wish for more cushioning and motion control. But judging from my runs, this is also an excellent shoe for beginners up to intermediate runners and makes an excellent daily trainer with a lot of style.",
