  "total_score": "84",
  "pros": "Superb construction quality; Accommodates broad feet well; Flexible and comfortable; Stable ride; A rockered design that works; Doubles as a walking or gym shoe; Good airflow",
  "cons": "Could be lighter; Pricier compared to other daily trainers; Weird lacing system",
  "RR_verdict": "The On Cloudflyer 4 stirred up a range of emotions within us. On the positive side, we encounter top-notch construction at a time when this seems to be a waning quality among most brands. Furthermore, it offers us a stable and enjoyable ride. However, the flip side is its potentially steep price for beginners, who are indeed the main target group for this shoe. It's also too heavy and features an unconventional lacing system that could be frustrating for some.",
