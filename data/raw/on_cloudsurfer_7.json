  "total_score": "86",
  "pros": "Excellent shock absorption and energy return; Soft and squishy midsole; Smooth and fun ride; Rockered design promotes buttery transitions; Great for short and mid-distance runs; Performs well at high speed; No speedboard means it’s no longer stiff; Super comfy upper; Snug and secure lockdown; Plush tongue prevents even a hint of lace bite; Lightweight for such a well padded shoe; Stylish and sustainability minded design",
  "cons": "Overall issues with durability; Somewhat unstable at longer distances; Not ideal for heavy-set individuals; Pricey for a daily trainer",
  "RR_verdict": "The Cloudsurfer 7 is On’s most cloud-like shoe we’ve tested to date. From the frankly decadent level of internal padding that feels like sliding our feet into fluffy balls of cotton, to the plush and lively midsole that rides like bouncing weightlessly through the air. If we can look past its hefty price tag, the Cloudsurfer 7 is a shoe that brings fun and speed to our daily runs with an exceptional level of comfort.",
