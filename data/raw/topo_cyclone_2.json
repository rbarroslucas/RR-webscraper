  "total_score": "89",
  "pros": "Exceptionally roomy, foot-shaped toebox; Outstanding value for the price; Full-length Pebax midsole; Impressively flexible for a natural ride; Snappy, lightweight and fun; Great as a plateless racing shoe; Sticky rubber delivers great grip; Excels in track workouts and intervals; Superb breathability",
  "cons": "Not ideal for narrow-footed runners; Limited cushioning; Not very stable; Durability concerns",
  "RR_verdict": "The Topo Cyclone 2 is a true standout in the lightweight performance category, delivering a highly-responsive, feather-light ride with an ultra-spacious toebox that allows natural toe splay. In our lab tests, we were impressed by the full-length Pebax midsole and the shoe’s nimble feel, making it perfect for fast workouts and tempo runs. The breathable upper kept our feet cool, and the grip performed beyond expectations. While it lacks heel stability and feels slightly firmer than we preferred, we believe its versatility, fun ride, and outstanding value make it a fantastic choice for many runners.",
