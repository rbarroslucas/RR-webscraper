  "RR_verdict": "We found that the New Balance Fresh Foam X 860 v14 is a solid mild-stability shoe, ideal for those who prefer a plush ride paired with support. In our lab tests, we were impressed by its comfortable ride, whether for jogging, running, or walking. However, the upper needs improvements, and the shoe is slightly heavier than expected. Despite these downsides, we think it offers a great blend of stability, cushioning, and comfort for everyday use—especially at its reasonable price point.",
