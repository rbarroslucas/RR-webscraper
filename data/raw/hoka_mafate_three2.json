  "pros": "Unique mix of two shoes; Serves as casual retro footwear; Accurate heel-to-toe drop; Exceptional Vibram outsole; Outstanding durability; Maximal cushioning; Excellent stability; Breathable",
  "cons": "Lacks reflective elements; Quite heavy; Only for narrow feet",
  "RR_verdict": "The Hoka Mafate Three2 is a rare blend of two shoes—the Mafate 2 and 3, combining its midsole and upper. We found that this unique mix offers a maximalist, cushioned experience suitable for occasional trail running and regular walking. However, we think its significant weight, steep price, and snug fit may not appeal to serious trail runners seeking a lighter, more agile shoe.",
