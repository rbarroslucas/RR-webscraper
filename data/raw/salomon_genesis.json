  "pros": "Premium MATRYX upper; Great for summer adventures; Comfortable for long distances; Perfect for heel strikers; Reasonably priced; Smooth and flexible ride; Super stable",
  "cons": "Missing reflective elements; Outsole wears quickly; Drop too high for some",
  "RR_verdict": "The Salomon Genesis truly stands out as a versatile trail workhorse in our lab, effortlessly managing everything from easy runs to ultra marathons. We found its MATRYX upper sets a high standard in both breathability and durability, paired with a stable midsole and a grippy—though not the most enduring—outsole. Finally, we believe its pricing is justified, especially with its superior fit over previous Salomon offerings.",
