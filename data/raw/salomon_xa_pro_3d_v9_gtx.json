  "pros": "Incredibly protective; Extremely stable and supportive; Great traction even on wet surfaces; Watertight Gore-Tex upper; Flexible and forgiving on the foot; Makes a great hiking companion; Effectively dampens landings; Generously padded from heel to tongue; No lace bite whatsoever; Durable, high-quality construction; Simple yet snazzy design",

  "RR_verdict": "The Salomon XA Pro 3D v9 GTX is a waterproof trail runner that supports, protects, and pampers our feet while keeping them dry through all our outdoor adventures. Thanks to its 3D Chassis and grippy outsole, we enjoyed an extremely stable and surefooted ride while testing this shoe, whether out for a light run or a backpacking journey. While it could use a bit of a diet as a more serious running shoe, we think that its versatility and the comfort we experienced make it worth every penny.",
