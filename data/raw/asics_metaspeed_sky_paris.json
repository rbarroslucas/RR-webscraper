  "cons": "Not suitable for heel strikers; Less stable than Sky+",
  "RR_verdict": "ASICS has truly outdone itself with the Metaspeed Sky Paris, elevating it to one of the finest supershoes ever crafted. In our lab and road tests, we witnessed remarkable improvements across the board, with the new midsole stealing the show—its energy return is simply off the charts. We were also amazed by the drastic reduction in weight. On the downside, it's somewhat less stable than its predecessor and remains quite expensive.",
