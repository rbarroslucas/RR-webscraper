  "pros": "Screams fast and speed-ready; Nike’s lightest racing shoe yet; Stable and good at cornering; Incredible lockdown; Splendid track workhorse; Roomy toe box; Eye-catching design; Not so expensive!",
  "cons": "Narrow-footed runners may experience poor lockdown; Insanely thin laces; Falls short for racing; Heavy runners can “bottom out”",
  "RR_verdict": "The Nike ZoomX Streakfly is the Oregonian's answer to the critically acclaimed Adidas Adizero Takumi Sen, a phenomenal and fast modern-day racing flat. Commended for being fast, this shoe surprised us in the lab with its comfortable ride and pleasant upper. While not the ultimate short-distance racing shoe, we found this non-plated hyper-light Nike racer to be an excellent tool for a wide variety of workouts.",
