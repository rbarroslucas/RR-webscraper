  "pros": "Unintrusive stability; Versatile (walking, gym, casual); Well-fitting; Doesn’t catch pebbles; Good breathability; Excellent grip; Lasting durability; Appealing design; Recycled content (30-35%)",
  "cons": "Not for severe overpronation; Firm and dull ride; A bit heavy",
  "RR_verdict": "The On Cloudrunner left us impressed as it's a daily trainer with a touch of pronation control and a firmer, more traditional ride. We found it an appealing option for entry-level runners who go shorter distances at slower paces and also like to have one shoe for daily wear and the gym. Apart from being an attractive, quality-made shoe, the fact that it contains sustainable materials is also a plus for us.",
