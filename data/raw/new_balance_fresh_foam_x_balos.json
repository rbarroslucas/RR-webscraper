  "brand": "New Balance",
  "total_score": "90",
  "pros": "Plush, cloud-like cushioning; Amazing rockered geometry; Lightweight for its size; Breathable, moisture-wicking upper; Excellent ground feedback from EVA outsole; Ideal for long runs and recovery days; Works for walking if needed; Fantastic knit tongue; Superb for midfoot strikers; 360-degree reflectivity",
  "cons": "Low-volume toebox; Price feels a bit excessive; Not enough energy return; EVA outsole raises durability concerns",
  "RR_verdict": "The Fresh Foam X Balos delivers a unique running experience with its ultra-rockered sole and plush foam. We found the premium upper and unfiltered ground feel exceptional during our runs, making it a standout for easy and recovery miles. However, in our lab tests, the minimal rubber coverage and lack of a full-PEBA midsole left us questioning its high price tag.",
