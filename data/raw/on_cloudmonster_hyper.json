  "total_score": "89",
  "pros": "Roomy upper for a performance shoe; Lighter than the Cloudmonster 2; High-quality materials; Well-balanced stack and stability; Comfortable for easy runs; Durable outsole; Wonderful lacing system",
  "cons": "High price; Not the best for heel strikers; Needs more ventilation",
  "RR_verdict": "The On Cloudmonster Hyper is a wonderful blend of the racer Cloudboom Echo 3 and the daily trainer Cloudmonster 2. We found that it boasts the responsive Helion HF foam and the weight savings of the former while adopting the CloudTec design and robust outsole of the latter—minus the Speedboard plate to enhance flexibility. Despite its premium price and some breathability issues, we think it’s a fantastic attempt by On at crafting its first supertrainer.",
