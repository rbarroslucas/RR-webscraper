  "brand": "The North Face",
  "total_score": "90",
  "pros": "Eye-catching design; Well cushioned for heel strikers; Fantastic durability; Snug lockdown; Stability-boosting TPU plate; Fun, rockered ride; Reliable grip on moderate terrain; Cushioned tongue for max comfort",
  "cons": "Tapered toebox; Advertised drop is misleading; Not breathable; EVA foam lacks bounce",
  "RR_verdict": "The North Face is widely recognized for its apparel, but in our experience, the Vectiv Enduris 3 proves they can deliver a serious trail shoe too. We found its durability exceptional, the grip dependable, and the stability ideal for heel strikers. While the drop is steeper than advertised and the toebox restricts natural toe splay, its bold, head-turning design offers a refreshing alternative for those seeking something beyond mainstream shoe brands.",
