  "pros": "Wear-resistant, durable outsole; Comfortable upper; Exceptional for heel strikers; Doubles as a versatile lifestyle shoe; HIgh-quality build; Innovative tongue; World-class stability; Stability-focused footbed",
  "cons": "Limited breathability; Not for forefoot strikers; Extra-firm midsole feel; It's still too heavy!",
  "RR_verdict": "The Brooks Beast GTS 24 fully lives up to its name with unparalleled stability and long-lasting outsole durability—qualities we found are hard to match. However, its substantial weight and firm midsole create a ride that’s anything but lively, fun or energetic. Still, for those focused on stability and value over speed or lightness, this shoe it’s undeniably a... beast!",
