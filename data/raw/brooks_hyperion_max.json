  "pros": "Seamless, comfortable upper; Exceptionally bouncy DNA Flash midsole; Remarkably lightweight; Secure, snug fit; Fantastic performance in winter; Versatile across various paces; Excellent stability; Superior breathability; Highly durable",
  "cons": "High price tag at $170; Subpar grip in wet conditions; Not for wide feet",
  "RR_verdict": "With its astonishingly light build and bouncy midsole that brings a spring to every step, the Brooks Hyperion Max truly offers an exceptional running experience that's good for all four seasons. That said, we found the shoe's upper is on the snug side and is particularly optimized for neutral runners. If this fits your running profile, this agile shoe stands out as an excellent daily trainer that can also keep up with quicker tempos.",
