  "total_score": "79",
  "pros": "Enhanced tongue padding; Exceptional value; Spacious, accommodating fit; Highly breathable upper; Suitable for all footstrikes; Improved Amplifoam+ midsole; Doubles as a lifestyle shoe; Secure, snug lockdown",
  "cons": "Upper lacks durability; Outsole needs improvement; Low forefoot cushioning",
  "RR_verdict": "The Gel Contend 9 exemplifies ASICS' conservative innovation, integrating numerous minor improvements while avoiding drastic changes. We really liked the plush upper and the springier midsole, affirming its status as an excellent beginner-friendly shoe that delivers superb value. However, we found the upper's durability lacking and the outsole underwhelming. But despite these minor issues, we believe the shoe maintains strong appeal and value, remaining a reliable option for casual runners not focused on long-distance performance.",
