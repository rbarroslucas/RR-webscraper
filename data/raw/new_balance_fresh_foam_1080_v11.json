  "RR_verdict": "I found the New Balance Fresh Foam More 1080 v11 a daily running shoe where comfort is paramount! So much so that it lags behind in performance. Where it shines, however, is in its grip and surprisingly light weight. The grip was just flawless - on cement, wet, and icy sections, it kept my strides stable.",
