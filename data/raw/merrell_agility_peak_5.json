  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Outstanding Vibram Megagrip outsole; Easily handles tough trails; Performs well on both downhills and uphills; Extremely durable upper with numerous TPU reinforcements; Suitable for year-round use; Loads of recycled, eco-friendly stuff; Great for long-distance runs thanks to its cushioning; Wonderful for heel strikers; Excellent all-terrain shoe",
  "cons": "Heavier than expected; Actual drop deviates significantly from what's stated; Could be more affordable; Narrow toebox",
  "RR_verdict": "The Agility Peak 5 from Merrell builds on its predecessor's success, offering key updates. We found the latest version lighter and more stable, especially with its improved Vibram Megagrip outsole and strategic lug design. The nearly 40-mm stack height offers exceptional muscle protection, making it ideal for diverse trail challenges. While it excels in cushioning and comfort, we still see room for improvement, particularly in reducing weight and refining the design for forefoot and midfoot strikers.",
