  "total_score": "89",
  "pros": "Exceptionally breathable upper; Ideal cushioning for heel strikers; Durable Continental outsole; Excellent foot lockdown; Comfortable sock-like tongue; Outstanding performance of Boost in cold temperatures; Works well as both a running shoe and a casual sneaker; Recycled materials",
  "cons": "It's too heavy and Boost doesn't feel bouncy; Insufficient cushioning in the forefoot; Priced at $180, it doesn't quite match its performance",
  "RR_verdict": "In the realm of running shoes, we've found that the Adidas Ultraboost holds its own crown as a bestseller, despite its steep $180 price tag. It excels in breathability, outsole durability, and above all, its versatility as a fashionable-and-cozy everyday sneaker. However, despite its widespread popularity, we noticed that the shoe doesn't mask its flaws when it comes to running—it's simply too heavy and the Boost foam felt boring in all of our test runs.",
