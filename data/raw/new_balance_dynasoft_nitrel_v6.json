  "brand": "New Balance",
  "total_score": "75",
  "pros": "Comfortable for all-day wear; Superbly stable; Good as one-travel shoe; Exceptional value; Enhanced durability; Great for hiking and walking; Breathability; Natural, low-to-the-ground experience",
  "cons": "Non-gusseted tongue; Lacks cushioning; Not for heel strikers; Weight increase",
  "RR_verdict": "In our view, the New Balance DynaSoft Nitrel v6 remains a solid budget-friendly trail contender, albeit with mixed updates. Its minimal cushioning and low offset pose challenges for heavier runners and heel strikers, yet we were impressed by the enhanced stability and the upper's improved ventilation. Nonetheless, for midfoot or forefoot strikers looking for a pocket-friendly, door-to-trail shoe, we think this model really shines through its limitations.",
