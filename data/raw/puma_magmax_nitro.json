  "total_score": "91",
  "pros": "Endless cushioning; Stretchy, comfortable tongue; Outstanding traction; Rock-solid stability; Responsive midsole; Ideal for long-distance training; Great for heel strikers; Good value for being a supertrainer",
  "cons": "Heavier than most competitors; Outsole shows fast wear; Lacks agility",
  "RR_verdict": "We think the MagMax Nitro lives up to its name with max cushion, max stack, and max comfort. On top of that, it's far more stable than its height suggests. However, we found it a bit heavy and sluggish for faster efforts. Still, Puma's first serious leap into maximalist category seems promising—meeting the needs of runners who’ve long awaited a super-sized cat!",
