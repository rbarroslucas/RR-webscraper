  "RR_verdict": "The Saucony Peregrine 14 refines its winning formula with a few precise tweaks. We found that it remains an excellent pick for value, comfort and versatility. We were also pleased to see it address many of its previous shortcomings, such as the thin tongue. Although the ride remains somewhat firm and would benefit from increased energy return, our tests confirm it remains a top contender as one of the best versatile trail shoes for yet another year.",
