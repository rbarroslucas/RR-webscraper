  "pros": "Extremely lightweight; Remarkably stable despite its massive height; Works for both long and short runs; Delivers a fun, rockered ride; Handles various paces effectively; Exceptional energy return; Ideal for runners covering high mileage; Outstanding durability; Amazing lockdown",
  "cons": "$200 for a daily trainer, wow!; Subpar breathability; The outsole is a stone trapper",
  "RR_verdict": "The ASICS Superblast isn't just another maximalist running shoe—it's a game-changer. Fusing elite FF Turbo foam with a massive stack height, lightweight design, and unbeatable stability, we felt it’s like running in a Novablast 3 on steroids. Whether you're aiming for easy runs, tempo training or races, this supertrainer rises to the occasion, although its incredible performance does come with a significant $200 price tag.",
