  "RR_verdict": "In the fiercely competitive entry-level market, we think New Balance is really going for the top spot with the 680 v8. We were impressed by its surprising inclusion of Fresh Foam in a budget-friendly package—this midsole, coupled with a durable yet breathable upper, makes it an excellent choice for daily wear. In our tests, we found it extremely comfortable, though it lacks stability features, making it best suited for neutral runners.",
