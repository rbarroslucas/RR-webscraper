  "pros": "Exceptional cushioning; Innovative H-shaped carbon plate; Tank-like durability; Comfy knit upper; Excellent stability; Superior PEBA foam; Smooth rockered ride; Fantastic energy return",
  "cons": "Excessively heavy; Narrow fit; Not for fast paces at all",
  "RR_verdict": "We were thrilled by the extreme cushioning of the Hoka Skyward X, though we were less impressed with its weight and somewhat restrictive fit. Despite these drawbacks, for anyone craving maximum foam underfoot and superior stability, this shoe feels like a dream come true on long runs. It's also super durable and offers a fun rockered ride, making it a mixed bag of incredible highs and notable lows.",
