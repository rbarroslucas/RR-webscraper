  "RR_verdict": "The New Balance FuelCell Rebel v4 is a bold refresh, crafted to preserve its famously fun ride with a sleek, low-stack midsole, while boosting both fit and stability. In our runs, we were also excited to discover its upgraded midsole, which now provides better energy return. However, even though it remains as light as before, we found that this update has lost some agility and spark due to its wider dimensions.",
