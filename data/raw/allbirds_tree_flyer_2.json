  "total_score": "86",
  "pros": "Environmentally friendly; Breathable knit upper; Good impact dampening; Snug sock-like fit; Accommodating toebox; Secure heel hold; Quite flexible and comfy; Smooth and stable ride; Works as a walker or gym shoe",
  "cons": "Quite heavy; Pricey for a daily trainer; Not so responsive",
  "RR_verdict": "The Allbirds Tree Flyer 2 proves that being eco-friendly isn't just for the birds. From its eucalyptus-based upper to the BioPebax midsole derived from castor beans and the heavy use of recycled materials, we can't help but love all the environmentally responsible features crammed into this shoe. What's more, we were pleasantly surprised with just how nicely it rides during our less intense daily runs. While its hefty weight and even heftier price tag are a little prohibitive, we think it is worth it to support a brand dedicated to reducing the carbon footprint of their shoes and look forward to further improvements coming in the future!",
