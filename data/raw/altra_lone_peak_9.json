  "brand": "Altra",
  "total_score": "92",
  "pros": "True zero-drop geometry; Extra-roomy, foot-shaped toebox; Vibram option finally available; Improved forefoot stability; Flat-profile, natural ride; Secure lacing system; Still a low-stack shoe!; Standard and wide versions; Good durability",
  "cons": "Feels really heavy for its size; Stiffer than previous versions; Lacks airflow; Having two outsole versions adds confusion",
  "RR_verdict": "The Altra Lone Peak 9 is a solid evolution, but not without some setbacks. We found in the lab that it gained weight, became noticeably stiffer, and still struggles with breathability. For our feet, those are clear and concerning issues. However, it remains a go-to pick for zero-drop lovers thanks to its flat midsole, ultra-generous toebox, and low-stack profile—all paired with a fantastic Vibram Megagrip outsole, though it’s a paid upgrade not sold everywhere.",
  "awards": "Top pick in best running shoes with a wide toebox, Top pick in best zero drop running shoes, Top 4% in trail running shoes, Top 6% in Altra running shoes, Top 13% most popular running shoes",
