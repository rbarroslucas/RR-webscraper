  "RR_verdict": "The Nike Pegasus 38 was already one of my favorite daily workhorses. With an added easy on/off FlyEase zipper and lacing, I found the Pegasus 38s more accessible not only to me but to more people. I also felt fast when clocking in miles with this one, so that's definitely a plus!",
