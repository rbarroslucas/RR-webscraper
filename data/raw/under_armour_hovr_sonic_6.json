  "total_score": "82",
  "pros": "Built-to-last outsole; Stable ride for neutral runners; Comfortable upper with plush padding; Great for walking; All-around reflectivity; Affordable price; Can handle gym workouts",
  "cons": "Poor breathability; Firm midsole; Narrow toebox limits toe splay; Lacks energy return",
  "RR_verdict": "The Under Armour HOVR Sonic 6 is a firm-riding workhorse that suits runners who dislike plush running shoes. The upper provides superb comfort but lacks breathability, which could be a drawback in warm climates. However, the outsole is impressively durable—we tested it in the lab and were genuinely impressed by its resilience. And while its flexibility makes it a solid option for walking and all-day wear, the firm foam and snug fit may not accommodate every runner’s needs.",
