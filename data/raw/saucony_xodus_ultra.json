  "total_score": "87",
  "pros": "Protective cushion; Responsive ride; Extremely comfy for ultras; Grippy on mud and loose ground; Breathable; Lighter than the Xodus 11; Stable platform; Wide-feet friendly",
  "cons": "Midfoot is too roomy; Lace change needed for good lockdown",
  "RR_verdict": "The Xodus Ultra from Saucony is a trail running shoe for ultra distances. We definitely felt that it let go of the beefy and burly signature of the past Xodus, shedding off a significant amount of weight. We found that it can go fast and far with its responsive and uber-comfy ride. And if you want a shoe that has protection written all over it, the Saucony Xodus Ultra is IT as we witnessed it crush through both well-groomed and rugged terrains like they're nothing.",
