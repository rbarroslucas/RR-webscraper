  "total_score": "90",
  "pros": "Fully gusseted tongue; Reflective elements; Durable upper construction; New rockered sole; Great for heel strikers; Reasonably priced; All-around comfort",
  "cons": "Weight increase; Possibly too plush for trails; Still lacks traction",
  "RR_verdict": "Nike has completely revamped the Pegasus Trail 5. We discovered that it now features a superior ReactX midsole, a roomier upper, and higher-quality materials—all for the same price. Durability is also impressive for being a road-to-trail shoe. However, we believe the grip is still lacking, and there's a slight weight increase that could have been avoided.",
