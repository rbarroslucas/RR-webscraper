  "RR_verdict": "Lifestyle brand turns to performance running? A $300 running shoe from APL (Athletic Propulsion Labs)!!! While it also happens to be the most expensive trainer on the market, I found that it doesn’t even come with a carbon plate… All in all, I think it is all right for the first attempt from a non-running brand. But it does have flaws, the biggest being the $300 price tag.",
