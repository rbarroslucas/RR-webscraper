  "total_score": "78",
  "pros": "High-quality upper; Exceptional value; Rock-solid stability; Perfect for new runners; Feels lighter than it seems; Doubles as an everyday shoe; Reliable lockdown with gusseted tongue; Good breathability",
  "cons": "Lackluster outsole; Minimal energy return; Not as soft as marketed; Not roomy at all",
  "RR_verdict": "The Nike Journey Run is perfect for beginners or those focused on short (slow) runs—we really believe that’s where it truly excels. In our experience, it lacks the cushioning and energy return needed for longer distances or speed sessions. That said, we were impressed by its plush, premium-feel upper, reliable stability, and, most importantly, its budget-friendly price!",
