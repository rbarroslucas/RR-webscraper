  "total_score": "89",
  "pros": "Optimized for trail races; Accommodates wide feet with ease; Full-length, responsive Pebax midsole; Equipped with a Vibram Megagrip outsole; Ideal for long-distance training; Offers outstanding comfort; Remarkably stable; Suitable for 100-mile races",
  "cons": "The Vaporweave upper could be more durable and breathable; Heavier than expected even for a trail racing shoe; The $260 price tag might be steep for some; Limited toebox height",
  "RR_verdict": "Nike enthusiasts have long awaited a Vaporfly for the trails, and the Ultrafly delivers, though with some unexpected twists. We can confirm that it combines a full-length ZoomX midsole, carbon plate, and Vibram Megagrip outsole for stellar performance, albeit a bit heavier than ideal. While its upper might not please all runners and the price is steep, in our tests, the Ultrafly stands out as a superb trail shoe, offering a plush ride and exceptional performance for long-distance training and racing.",
