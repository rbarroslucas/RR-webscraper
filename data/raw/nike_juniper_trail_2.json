  "brand": "Nike",
  "total_score": "76",
  "pros": "Great value at just $85; Durable upper; Can handle road runs if needed; Exceptional stability; Perfectly suited for heel strikers; More cushioning than v1; Roomy and comfortable",
  "cons": "Grip could be better; Might feel too firm and stiff; Not ideal for long-distance running",
  "RR_verdict": "At an attractive $85, the Nike Juniper Trail 2 is a budget-friendly gem for those seeking Pegasus Trail features without breaking the bank. Ideal for short to medium runs on gentle terrain, this road-to-trail shoe offers real stability and comfort. However, its affordability does mean some trade-offs, like a subpar traction and less energy return from its firm midsole. Yet in our experience, for beginners or those not focused on speed or technical terrains, these compromises are hardly noticeable.",
