  "brand": "New Balance",
  "total_score": "71",
  "pros": "Value-packed price; Surprisingly stable underfoot feel; Breathable, premium-feel upper; Semi-gusseted tongue improves lockdown; Ideal for midfoot strikers; Great step-in comfort from day one; Best New Balance under 100 bucks",
  "cons": "Lower drop won't suit everyone; Noticeably heavier and stiffer than its predecessor; Not for wide feet; Grips falls short on slick surfaces",
  "RR_verdict": "The New Balance Fresh Foam X Evoz v4 left us with mixed feelings in the lab. We really liked its plush-and-breathable upper that felt great on our runs, with thoughtful touches like the semi-gusseted tongue and well-cushioned heel padding that made the fit extra cozy. That said, we were let down by its hefty weight and underwhelming traction on slick surfaces. And while it’s more of a design choice than a flaw, we think the snug fit will feel too cramped for many runners.",
