  "RR_verdict": "The Nike Winflo 11 GTX impressed us in the lab with its winter-ready comfort, plush cushioning, and exceptional traction on wet surfaces. We were particularly surprised by how well it balances these features with an affordable price for a Gore-Tex shoe. However, in our testing, we noted some drawbacks, such as its steep heel-to-toe drop, limited stability, and concerns about outsole durability.",
