  "pros": "Spacious toebox; Protective TPU rock plate; Ultra-durable and grippy Vibram outsole; Breathable upper; Fully-gusseted tongue; Secure lockdown; Versatile design works for hiking too; Versatile lug design; Water-repellent footbed",
  "cons": "Heavier than it looks; Midsole feels a bit firm; Upper lacks durability; Limited stability",
  "RR_verdict": "We think the Topo Traverse is a well-rounded choice for those looking to hike and run in the same shoe. Its Vibram outsole grips well, the upper allows great airflow, and the foot-shaped toebox provides a natural and relaxed fit. That said, we found that the upper may wear down sooner than expected, and its weight slightly reduces agility, even though it’s not among the most cushioned trail shoes.",
