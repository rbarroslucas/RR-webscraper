  "RR_verdict": "The ASICS Jolt 4 is a budget daily trainer that's best suited for beginners and casual runners. It's a stable and well-padded shoe that feels great right out of the box. While its EVA midsole is nothing to write home about, it effectively protects us from impact while out on easy runs or walks about town and is firm enough to work as a gym trainer.",
