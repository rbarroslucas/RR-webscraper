  "RR_verdict": "In our view, the Nike Winflo 11 remains a fantastic value-oriented running shoe. We were delighted to discover that it's now more spacious and cushioned, and now it boasts an upgraded engineered mesh upper that enhances breathability and durability. On the downside, it's heavier and less stable than its predecessor, but this doesn't stop us from recommending it. For any neutral runner with budget considerations, the Winflo 11 is a really solid choice.",
