  "shoe_name": "PUMA Fast-R Nitro Elite 2",
  "brand": "PUMA",
  "total_score": "81",
  "pros": "Enhanced energy return; Ultra-breathable upper; Exceptional grip; Max race-day legal stack; Highly responsive; Works for all footstrikes; Great for marathons",
  "cons": "Excessively heavy; Odd-feeling decoupled heel; Pricier than most supershoes",
  "RR_verdict": "The Puma Fast-R Nitro Elite 2 takes a daring approach with unique features like a decoupled heel and extended carbon-fiber plate, creating an unusual ride that may not suit everyone. We found in the lab that it's also really heavy for a modern supershoe, and stability could be better. However, we enjoyed its wild ride and design. In our view, this shoe caters to those looking for a departure from the ordinary, though it has multiple drawbacks that cannot be overlooked.",
