  "pros": "Premium materials; Vibram Megagrip outsole; Low carbon footprint; Race-ready fit; Lightweight; Stable, grounded ride with tons of feedback; Ideal for short races and skyrunning events; Handles corners with ease; Doubles as a hiking shoe",
  "cons": "Not the best for heel strikers; High price tag; Limited breathability; No reflective elements",
  "RR_verdict": "We found the NNormal Kjerag to be an impressive first entry in the market for this new brand, bringing a fresh approach to trail racing shoes. Built with top-tier materials like MATRYX and Vibram Megagrip, this lightweight, close-to-ground racer delivers a fun, responsive feel. In our view, it’s designed for those with solid trail skills and a forefoot or midfoot strike, making it a dream choice for trail runners who value agility over cushion—though this quality comes with a high price tag.",
