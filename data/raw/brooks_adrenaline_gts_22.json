  "RR_verdict": "One of Brooks’ most revered and popular stability shoes gets a well-needed modern update for 2022. I love this daily runner because I see it as the Jack-of-all-trades running shoe, thanks to a bi-directional correction for different overpronations. With fresher looks, I am captivated by its even more attractive silhouette.",
