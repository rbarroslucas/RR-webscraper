  "pros": "The Zoom Fly is back!; Fairly priced; Versatile, performance-ready supertrainer; Reasonable weight; Can handle all paces; Comfortable upper; Outstanding durability; Amazing for tempo and marathon workouts",
  "cons": "Toebox is narrow and restrictive; SR-02 foam lacks bounce; Could be more stable",
  "RR_verdict": "We were impressed by how the Zoom Fly 6 addressed the shortcomings of its predecessor. With energetic ZoomX foam, a carbon plate, and a lighter build, it performed wonderfully in our lab. In our experience, its fantastic durability and versatility make it a true supertrainer at a fair price. While the snug toebox and narrow dimensions may not suit everyone, we believe this version successfully puts the series back on track.",
