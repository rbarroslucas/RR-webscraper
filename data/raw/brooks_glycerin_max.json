  "pros": "Massive cushioning; Luxurious yet breathable upper; Innovative DNA Tuned midsole; Eye-catching look; Surprisingly stable; Can be used as a walking shoe; Premium materials",
  "cons": "Too heavy; Bulky, non-gusseted tongue; Poor rubber coverage; High price tag",
  "RR_verdict": "The Glycerin Max is Brooks’ ambitious response to the rise of ultra-cushioned running shoes. We found it truly provides cloud-like comfort underfoot, protecting your muscles and joints with its innovative DNA Tuned midsole. We also found that the plush, breathable upper offers a premium, glove-like fit—though this luxurious feel comes at a cost in terms of price and weight, both being higher than we hoped.",
