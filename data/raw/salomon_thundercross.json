  "pros": "Exceptional stability; Highly durable; Versatile across various paces; Outsole provides excellent grip, even on inclines; Impressively lightweight; Performs well on multiple surfaces; Quiet on roads; Reasonably priced at $140",
  "cons": "Not for summer; Could benefit from additional cushioning; The very low drop may not suit everyone",
  "RR_verdict": "The Salomon Thundercross bursts onto the trail running scene as a versatile shoe, capable of handling a diverse range of terrains and paces, all at a reasonable $140. We found its traction on challenging terrain quite impressive, alongside a durable and spacious upper, and a midsole that delivers a bouncy ride. In our tests, we noticed it falls short in breathability, and the 3.0-mm heel-to-toe drop may not suit all runners. However, we believe Salomon's endeavor to address a previously unfilled gap in their lineup is praiseworthy, and the Thundercross is an excellent option for those in search of a versatile shoe for their trail runs or hikes.",
