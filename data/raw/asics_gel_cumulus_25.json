  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Versatile daily trainer; Superb step-in feel; Firmer ride than the Nimbus 25; Great for long and slow days; Breezier runs in the summer; Feels light on feet; Grippy outsole; Stable ride; Great lockdown; No break-in needed",
  "cons": "Too high stacked for some; Feels flat underfoot; Not the best for speedier runs",
  "RR_verdict": "The 25th iteration of the Cumulus series from ASICS is lighter and comfier than ever based on our lab tests. This neutral running shoe sports a combination of ASICS tech that makes it a dependable daily trainer for taking on the next run when you want to go far at a steady pace. Its overall construction from the upper to the outsole is geared toward ensuring that runners have fatigue-free feet at the end of the day. We strongly believe that for the price, the Cumulus is one of the best options in its category.",
