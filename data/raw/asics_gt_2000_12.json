  "total_score": "90",
  "pros": "Stable yet non-intrusive; Built for endurance on long runs; Lightest model in its series; Top-notch comfort; FF Blast+ cushioning for the first time in a GT 2000; PureGel technology for heel strikers; Remarkable durability of the outsole; Great value at $140",
  "cons": "Breathability could be improved; Might require a brief break-in period",
  "RR_verdict": "ASICS continues to refine the GT 2000 series, and the 12th edition stands out as one of the best updates ever to its stability daily trainer. We found in the lab that it really builds on the strengths of its predecessors, now integrating world-class FF Blast+ cushioning, shaving off some weight, and boosting outsole durability. Moreover, it has perfected stability. We found that the 3D Guidance System, combined with the midsole dimensions and shoe geometry, makes this shoe a real gem, particularly for heel strikers with its high drop. In our experience, the major drawback is that it's so consistently good across the board, it's almost boring not to find any big flaw!",
