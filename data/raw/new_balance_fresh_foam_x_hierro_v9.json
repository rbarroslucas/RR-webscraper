  "brand": "New Balance",
  "total_score": "86",
  "pros": "So much foam underfoot!; Vibram Megagrip outsole; Cloud-soft Fresh Foam X midsole; Surprisingly stable; Amazing durability; Ideal for long distances; Available in multiple widths; Good quality materials; Excellent for forefoot and midfoot strikers",
  "cons": "Not the roomiest fit; Heavier than before; Lost its flexible nature; Low drop won't suit everyone",
  "RR_verdict": "The New Balance Fresh Foam X Hierro v9 is a bold reboot of the series. We found that it ditches its former flexible-and-grounded vibe for a stiff, max-cushioned platform with low-drop geometry and a rocker-assisted ride. While the new high-stack profile won’t please everyone, we were impressed by the plush foam, ultra-grippy Vibram Megagrip outsole, and trail-ready materials. However, if you’re chasing that familiar Hierro ride, prepare for a wake-up call.",
