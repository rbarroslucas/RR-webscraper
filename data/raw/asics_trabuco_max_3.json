  "pros": "Enhanced durability; Exceptional plush cushioning; Ideal for winter runs; Ultra distance-ready; Surprisingly stable; Reliable grip; Good-quality materials",
  "cons": "Reduced breathability; Increased weight; Slight price bump",
  "RR_verdict": "Our experience with the ASICS Trabuco Max 3 reveals a careful update, preserving its plush midsole, high stack height, reliable grip, and wide upper. However, it's worth mentioning that the shoe now offers less ventilation, comes with a slight price hike, and carries a bit more weight. Despite these changes, it still stands out in the max-cushioned trail shoe category for its balanced performance and rockered ride, ready for long runs and any ultra distances.",
