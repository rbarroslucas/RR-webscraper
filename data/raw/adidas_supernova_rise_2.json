  "total_score": "91",
  "pros": "Lighter than version 1; Comfortable yet breathable upper; Cold-proof PEBA midsole; Stable ride with Support Rods; Reflective accents for night visibility; Maintains competitive price tag; Responsive Dreamstrike+ foam; Flexible, natural running experience; Great for walking",
  "cons": "Outsole lacks Continental; Not ideal for forefoot strikers; Still lacks a gusseted tongue",
  "RR_verdict": "The Adidas Supernova Rise 2 makes some smart tweaks without taking any steps backward. We found a lighter build, a noticeably improved upper, a smooth-and-flexible midsole, and zero compromises in comfort or durability—all while keeping the same price as last year. There’s nothing overly bold or exaggerated in this shoe, and in our view, that’s part of its charm.",
