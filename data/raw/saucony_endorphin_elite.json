  "pros": "The finest Saucony racer yet; Remarkably lightweight; Impressively stable; Wide toebox; Ideal for marathons; Excellent foot lockdown; Exceptional energy return from PWRRUN HG",
  "cons": "Priced on the higher side at $275; Not the best pick for heel strikers; Grips less than most supershoes",
  "RR_verdict": "With the introduction of the Endorphin Elite, Saucony finally brings a true rival to the Vaporfly based on our tests. This racing shoe isn't just about its aggressive design featuring numerous cutouts—it's a performance beast. The PWRRUN HG midsole delivered to us maximum energy return with every stride during our test runs. To add, it has a durable-yet-grippy outsole ready for both wet and dry conditions, and an upper that's surprisingly roomy. All these premium features come with a premium price of $275, a consideration for budget-conscious runners.",
