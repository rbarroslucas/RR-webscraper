  "RR_verdict": "The Brooks Hyperion Max 2 is a notable upgrade, ideally pairing with any racing shoe for training. Although it's heavier than before and still lacks a premium PEBA superfoam, it offers a responsive ride, improved upper quality, and excellent stability. We also discovered that its narrow dimensions and mid-drop geometry are ideal for midfoot and forefoot strikers seeking a fast and agile tempo trainer.",
