  "cons": "Poor durability; Could use even more foam; Not for technical trails",
  "RR_verdict": "The Prodigio fills a notable gap in La Sportiva's lineup with its plush midsole, ideal for long distances. We really liked the comfortable ride and versatility the shoe offered during our runs. However, our lab tests uncovered a surprising downside—durability was significantly lacking. This is a major concern for us, particularly when recommending it to runners who aren't lightweight. In our experience, while the shoe performs wonderfully in terms of comfort and versatility, its short lifespan could be a dealbreaker for many.",
