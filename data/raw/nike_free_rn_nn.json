  "total_score": "74",
  "pros": "Feather-light on the foot; Extremely flexible and comfortable; Good impact dampening; Very accommodating toebox; Secure sock-like fit; Works well in the winter; Keeps the feet warm; High-quality and durable upper; Can handle gym day and some other activities; Sleek design; Budget-friendly",
  "cons": "Too toasty for warm weather; Not ideal for speedwork or long distances; Too broad for those with narrow feet",
  "RR_verdict": "When it comes to lightweight daily trainers on a budget, Nike nailed it with the Free RN NN. \"Barely there\", is the most apt way we can describe this shoe that truly feels like we're running barefoot. With its snug, sock-like fit the shoe seems to wrap itself around our foot while its incredibly flexible and forgiving nature leaves us feeling fresh after every session. Although we were certainly able to hit high speeds in this feathery shoe, we found that it's best suited for more steady paces for short to moderate distances.",
