  "brand": "Saucony",
  "total_score": "83",
  "pros": "More cushioned and protective than ever; Responsive foam; The lightest Kinvara yet; Offers some mild guidance; Good grip even on wet surfaces; Smooth, natural-feeling ride; Pleasantly airy; Works for fast and slow paces; Can go the distance; Also a worthy racing shoe; Fairly priced",
  "cons": "A bit on the firm side; Less outsole rubber means less mileage; Lockdown is so-so",
  "RR_verdict": "With its ultra-light upper, lofty cushioning, and modern insole, you wouldn’t be remiss to think that the Kinvara 14 had strayed from its path. While it’s no longer the lean mean Kinvaras of old that we enjoyed, this new version still boasts the flexible, natural-feeling, low-drop ride loyalists have come to know and love. And despite the radical overhaul, we believe that this Saucony favorite remains one of the best uptempo trainers for those on a budget.",
