  "total_score": "83",
  "pros": "Has some spring; Eats up impact; Low-profile midsole; Feels nimble and speedy; Snugly wraps around the foot; Comfortable all-day; Excellent for winter runs; Great traction; Durable knit upper; Come in multiple width options; Also for walking and gym training",
  "cons": "Rubs the heel; Stretchy upper impedes lockdown; Pricey for a daily trainer; Not ideal for warm days",
  "RR_verdict": "The Levitate Stealthfit 5 from Brooks is a road running shoe that we recommend best for short to mid-distance runs. We found that it's perfect for cruising along the pavement in comfort and style. Even better, it offers a snugger, more supportive fit than its parent model, the Brooks Levitate 5. It's a versatile trainer that can be used as a catch-all fitness shoe as it keeps our feet fresh whether out for a run, a walk, or at the gym. That said, its well-insulated knit upper and stellar performance in our freezer tests make it much better suited for those in cooler climates.",
