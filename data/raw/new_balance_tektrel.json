  "RR_verdict": "In our view, the New Balance Tektrel offers a fresh take on door-to-trail footwear, blending a striking design with adequate performance at an accessible price point, making it suitable for casual runners looking for a versatile option for both roads and trails. We noticed the ride was not as explosive as other models, and the outsole didn't impress us, but its unique appearance and low cost make it a viable choice for runners looking to get decent quality without breaking the bank.",
