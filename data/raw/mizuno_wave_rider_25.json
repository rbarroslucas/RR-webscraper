  "pros": "Lightweight; Comfortable; Breathable; Stable for pronators; Grippy; Durable",
  "cons": "Too much drop; Tall heel; Heel slip",
  "RR_verdict": "I am fond of using the Wave Rider 25 because it is a daily trainer that is flexible, comfortable, and perfect for heel strikers out there who need a ton of foam in the heel to softly dampen the impact. I find the shoe breathable, and light on the environment with its recycled mesh upper. It’s a great entry point into running shoes for the beginner runner but ultimately falls short for those looking for something a bit more high-performance.",
