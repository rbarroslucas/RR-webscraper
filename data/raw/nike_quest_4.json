  "RR_verdict": "Nike Quest 4 fills a niche with a trendy-looking shoe at a bargain price. If you desire that Nike swoosh and have less than in your pocket, I certainly recommend this shoe. There aren’t many affordable yet super-competitive options, but to my surprise, this stylish trainer fits the bill! I used it for easy short runs and thoroughly enjoyed its lightness and crazy good grip.",
