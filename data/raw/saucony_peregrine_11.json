  "RR_verdict": "A beast in all my trail runs, the Saucony Peregrine 11 was more than confidence-inspiring! It's a tank that mutes out all the harshness of the trails while eating up everything I throw at it! From slick mud, snow, dry, and rocky stream crossings, this shoe just bites hard and deep into the ground. It's also able to run fast, and I got exactly that in the Peregrine!",
