  "RR_verdict": "We've found the On Cloudflyer to be a distinctive blend of versatility and stability. It's loved by many, including us, for its superb build quality—a signature of On shoes. This shoe also offers a flexible yet stable ride, even suitable for overpronators. However, we noticed its firm midsole might not be for everyone. While the Swiss brand's pricing leans towards the higher end as usual, the Cloudflyer is a great all-rounder for those willing to pay a premium price.",
