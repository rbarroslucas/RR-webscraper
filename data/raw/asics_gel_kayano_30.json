  "brand": "ASICS",
  "total_score": "87",
  "pros": "Exceptionally cushioned; Impressively stable with 4D Guidance System; Lighter than it seems; Top-notch breathability; Effective maximalist design; Superior durability and comfort; Ideal for high-mileage runners; Ultra-plush FF Blast+ foam; Amazing build quality",
  "cons": "Actual drop exceeds stated measurement; Midsole might require a break-in period",
  "RR_verdict": "With the ASICS Gel Kayano 30, the renowned stability line takes a spirited leap forward. With increased foam but without the added weight, it's a win-win for almost everyone. Navigating the balance between plush comfort and stability, in our tests, the FF Blast+ with 4D Guidance System midsole excels. While it might be on the pricier side and has lighter competitors, we think it's hard to find fault with this shoe.",
