  "RR_verdict": "Stability runners rejoice! Upon logging the miles in the ASICS Gel Kayano Lite 2, I conclude that it is how stability shoes should be built. Gone are the days of plates, posts, and brick-like motion control shoes that weigh more than a pair of ski boots. I found everything that’s great about the original Kayano without any of the junk. If you need a little support while you run, check out the Kayano Lite 2!",
