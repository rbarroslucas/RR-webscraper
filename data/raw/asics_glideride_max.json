  "brand": "ASICS",
  "total_score": "92",
  "pros": "Tons of cushioning!; Smooth rockered ride; Secure and well-built upper; No heel slippage; Feels lighter than its stack suggests; Fantastic for high-mileage training; Optimized for heel strikers; Somewhat stable despite its size; World-class grip",
  "cons": "Pricey for its performance; Stiffer build limits comfort; Not the best for walking",
  "RR_verdict": "The ASICS Glideride Max offers deep cushioning and a smooth, well-balanced rocker, making it an excellent pick for easy, set-and-forget paces. However, its high price, stiff build and towering stack reduce versatility, excelling in long runs but falling short for speedwork or fartleks. In our lab tests, it impressed us with outstanding impact protection and solid performance across most evaluations, but we believe runners seeking a more responsive, adaptable ride may prefer a lighter, more flexible option.",
