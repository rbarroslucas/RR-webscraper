  "total_score": "79",
  "pros": "Flexible enough for walking and easy running; High breathability; EasyOn system; Incredible value; Good stability; Accesible for individuals with disabilities; Same price as regular Revolution 7; Great for heel strikers",
  "cons": "Limited durability of toebox mesh; Firm midsole; Thin forefoot cushioning; Tapered, low-volume toebox",
  "RR_verdict": "The Revolution 7 EasyOn retains the value-driven features of its standard sibling but elevates convenience with Nike’s clever EasyOn technology. We were impressed by how it maintains its budget-friendly price while adding a seamless, one-hand lacing system. In our testing, we also found it still has a firmer ride and a tapered toebox, which may not suit everyone, but for those seeking practical convenience at an unbeatable price, we believe the Revolution 7 EasyOn is second to none.",
