  "brand": "New Balance",
  "total_score": "87",
  "pros": "Insanely protective even without a rock plate; Soft cushioning without feeling mushy; Solid amount of bounce; Incredibly stable; Plush and airy upper; Good grip on mild to moderate trails; Durable outsole; Light on the run; Really smooth ride; Best for easy days and long runs; Sustainable",
  "cons": "Upper could use more support; Not great for technical trails; Pointy toebox",
  "RR_verdict": "With its gargantuan stack, supreme comfort, and commendable performance, the New Balance More Trail v3 has effectively ended Hoka’s years-long chokehold on the max-cushioned trail running throne. Though this tank of a shoe may seem sluggish and clumsy, it actually runs lighter than it looks, and we found it surprisingly bouncy and stable for its size—making it our top option for both 5-mph easy days and 50-mile ultra races.",
