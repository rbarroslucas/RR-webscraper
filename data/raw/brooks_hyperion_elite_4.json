  "brand": "Brooks",
  "total_score": "87",
  "pros": "World-class upper; Cushioned to legal limit; Personalized carbon plate; Good stability; Notched laces; Durable outsole; Less extreme than other supershoes; Superior build quality",
  "cons": "Narrow toebox and heel; Foam lacks energy return; Excessive weight for supershoe",
  "RR_verdict": "We found that Brooks' latest effort to deliver a competitive supershoe almost reaches the top tier, yet it still trails behind the best. In our lab tests, we observed impressive upgrades in the knit upper, outsole and carbon plate. Despite these enhancements, the supercritical EVA midsole still falls short on energy return, and the Hyperion Elite 4's weight is again hefty for its category. Given its steep $250 price tag, we believe further improvements are necessary for it to compete with the top racing shoes on the market.",
