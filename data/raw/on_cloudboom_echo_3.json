  "brand": "On",
  "total_score": "90",
  "pros": "Well-cushioned for marathon distances; High-energy return from Pebax foam; Offers a responsive and bouncy ride; Exceptionally breathable upper; Excellent for 5K and 10K runs; Semi-gusseted tongue; A wonder for those with narrow feet; Made from premium-quality materials",
  "cons": "Exorbitantly high price; Likely too narrow for most runners; Weight leans toward the heavier side",
  "RR_verdict": "The On Cloudboom Echo 3 is the brand's first legitimate supershoe, and it doesn't disappoint in the performance department. Featuring a snappy carbon plate, bouncy Pebax foam, and a uniquely rockered design, we found this shoe is built for speed, pure and simple. Despite some downsides like its high cost and heavier weight, it's more than capable of standing its ground against the top-tier supershoes, something we've been keenly awaiting from On.",
