  "total_score": "86",
  "pros": "Feather-light build; Ideal for 5K/10K races; Wild, fun and fast; Now features a carbon-fiber plate; Much quicker than its predecessor; Top-tier ZoomX foam; Perfect for track workouts; Not pricey all things considered; Can stretch up to half marathon; Grips well on dry and wet roads",
  "cons": "Not for heel strikers; Only for short distances; Narrow toebox; Lacks stability",
  "RR_verdict": "The Nike Streakfly 2 is a fully revamped shoe that, in our view, finally delivers what version 1 should have been: a supershoe for 5K/10K races. We loved its raw-and-fast feel, feather-light design, and super-reactive ride that brings a true track spike vibe to the roads. However, we believe its limited cushioning and narrow toebox limit its versatility, and its low-drop configuration excludes heel strikers too.",
