  "brand": "HOKA",
  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Lightweight and stable; Works across all paces; Comfortable for easy runs despite having a plate; Finally a Hoka Mach with Pebax foam; Well-suited for heel strikers; Offers exceptional breathability; Flexible and comfy despite having a plate",
  "cons": "Official drop measurement (5 mm) is inaccurate; The $180 price point might be steep for some",
  "RR_verdict": "During our tests, the Hoka Mach X masterfully married versatility with a feather-light design, thanks to a Pebax plate and a dual-layer springy midsole. Designed to excel in a range of activities—from tempo training and extensive 20-milers to easy runs—it impressively maintains stability despite its notable stack height. Yet, diverging from Hoka's signature cloud-like plushness, we found this model presents a distinctly firmer feel underfoot.",
