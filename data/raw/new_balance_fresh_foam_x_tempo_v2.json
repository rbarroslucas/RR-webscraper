  "brand": "New Balance",
  "total_score": "77",
  "pros": "Incredible value; Versatile for slow and tempo runs; Secure lockdown with gusseted tongue; Flexible and natural ride; Plush midsole; Encourages foot strength; Fantastic knit upper; Great choice for lightweight runners; Smooth transitions; Solid durability",
  "cons": "Not for long distance training; Lacks stability; Slightly heavy for its stack height; Best suited for low-volume feet",
  "RR_verdict": "We found that the New Balance Fresh Foam X Tempo v2 offers a close-to-the-ground ride with unexpectedly plush foam, blending modern cushioning with a sleek, low-profile feel. However, in our lab tests, We discovered a snug toebox that may not accommodate wider feet despite the knit upper, and its lack of stability makes it suitable only for those with a truly neutral running form. That said, it's a fun shoe (and we still need to care about that!), making its reasonable price a powerful reason to give it a shot.",
