  "total_score": "83",
  "pros": "Upper now has exceptional breathability; Stable yet non-restrictive ride; Cushioned enough for long runs; Handles walking too; Impressively wide platform; PWRRUN PB insole; Secure and comfortable lockdown; Excellent heel rocker design",
  "cons": "Lacks bounce; Too much exposed foam on outsole; Feels bulky and not agile; Midsole runs a bit firm",
  "RR_verdict": "Saucony took a cautious approach with the Guide 18, refining the upper for an ultra-breathable design while making only minor tweaks to flexibility and materials. We tested it extensively and found that while it remains a solid choice for stability seekers, Saucony missed a real opportunity to enhance the outsole and upgrade the foam. That said, it still delivers excellent value and dependable pronation control, living up to its name!",
