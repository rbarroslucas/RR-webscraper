  "brand": "Altra",
  "total_score": "79",
  "pros": "Perfectly versatile for both road running and easy trails; Spacious upper featuring Altra's FootShape design; Not as overly wide as some other Altra models; Attractively priced at $120; Excellent grip on fire roads and smooth trails; Natural, zero-drop running experience; Exceptional outsole durability; Comfortable enough for all-day wear",
  "cons": "Could benefit from being lighter; Insufficient cushioning for heel strikers; Not suitable for moderate to difficult trails",
  "RR_verdict": "The Altra Outroad 2 emerges as a road-to-trail option that delivers a well-rounded mix, mostly hitting high notes: It's priced right at $120, handles all roads and some trails, and its MaxTrac outsole offers both great grip and impressive longevity. In our tests in the lab, we really liked its foot-shaped design, combined with the authentic zero-drop running experience Altra is known for. On the flip side, we think that the foam could have a bit more energy return, and it's not the shoe for rugged trails or high-speed runs. All in all, we think that the Outroad 2 is a solid choice for those seeking a versatile, budget-friendly hybrid shoe that doesn't sacrifice comfort for performance.",
