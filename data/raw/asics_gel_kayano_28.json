  "pros": "Familiar Kayano fit; Roomier toebox; No lace bite; Added pep; No medial post; Lost weight; Kayano durability",
  "cons": "Heel slipping; Overly plush; Runs warm",
  "RR_verdict": "Still staying true to its Kayano roots, the Kayano 28 retains its hallmark of stability and support while seeing some updates that translate to amped-up comfort and flexibility in my wear tests. And with better flex, the shoe was just overall fun! Although designed as a daily trainer, I also find it fitting as a standalone shoe that you can take out of the closet during race day and on long, slow miles.",
