  "pros": "Exceptionally lightweight; Ideal for track workouts; Upper fits comfortably; Durable outsole and upper; Good breathability; Feels quick and agile; Great for developing foot muscles",
  "cons": "Midsole could benefit from more energy return; Not suitable for long runs at all; Might be slightly overpriced; Slippery when wet",
  "RR_verdict": "The Brooks Hyperion Tempo stands out as a low-stacked gem in a world dominated by maximalist running shoes. In our tests, it delivered a blend of old-school, racing-flat vibes in a sleek, modern package, and tipped the scales at just 7 ounces. While we found the midsole lacking energy return and the $150 price a bit steep, it's undoubtedly among the top choices for those seeking a versatile, non-plated shoe. It's perfect for easy jogs, tempo runs and track workouts, all wrapped in one.",
