  "RR_verdict": "Often dubbed as Adidas' version of the Hoka Bondi, we think that the Adidas Adistar is a max-cushioned running shoe that's a no-brainer for long easy days. With its highly cushioned design, it provides ample protection from shock during impact. On top of this, it nails the hallmark stability of the past Adidas Adistar collection despite it being a neutral shoe. However, one drawback worth noting is that we found the shoe to be too firm.",
