  "brand": "Nike",
  "total_score": "73",
  "pros": "High-quality Gore-Tex membrane; Lighter than the Pegasus Trail 5!; Fantastic for midfoot strikers; Doubles as a hiking and walking shoe; Good ReactX midsole; Amazing for winter; Can handle all-day adventures; Reasonable price hike",
  "cons": "Ankle instability for heel strikers; Upper lacks padding; Limited breathability; Grip falls short on technical terrain",
  "RR_verdict": "We liked the Nike Pegasus Trail 5 GTX for its smartly-engineered weight reductions—a rare achievement in waterproof footwear. In our lab tests, it performed exceptionally well across walking, hiking, and running on varied surfaces. While it sacrifices some breathability and comfort, the weather-resistant Gore-Tex upper and versatile design make it a reliable choice as an all-in-one shoe for cold, wet winters.",
