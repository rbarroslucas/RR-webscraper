  "brand": "New Balance",
  "total_score": "81",
  "pros": "Designed to fly at 5K/10K and half-marathon races; Wonderful for lighter runners; Cheaper than most supershoes; Ultra-breathable upper; Excels at interval training sessions; Improved compared to its predecessor; Perfect for classic racing flat enthusiasts; Plush and bouncy PEBA foam",
  "cons": "Should be even lighter for its stack height; Potential Achilles rubbing; Unstable heel; Short, non-gusseted tongue",
  "RR_verdict": "In our view, the New Balance FuelCell SuperComp Pacer v2 offers an entertaining and feedback-rich ride reminiscent of classic racing flats, making it a top choice for races from 5K to half marathon. While the heel design caused some discomfort and the weight is slightly higher than we’d prefer, we think it’s an excellent choice for lightweight runners seeking exceptional energy return and a carbon plate at a more affordable price than most supershoes.",
