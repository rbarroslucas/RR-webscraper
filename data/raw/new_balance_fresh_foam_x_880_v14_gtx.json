  "pros": "Winter-ready design; Cozy upper ensures all-day comfort; Stable ride; Durable construction; Soft midsole ideal for long distances; Lightweight build for a GTX shoe; Reliable traction on wet surfaces; Reflective elements; ",
  "cons": "High price bump from 880 v14; Gore-Tex integration could be better; Toebox is narrower than expected; Not ideal for forefoot strikers",
  "RR_verdict": "We tested the Fresh Foam X 880 v14 GTX and found it to be a great winter-ready version of the regular model. It keeps the same soft cushioning and long-lasting feel, now with a water-blocking upper that’s perfect for cold, wet days. We really liked how comfortable and stable it felt on our runs. However, we think the price bump from the non-GTX version is a bit steep, and the tighter toebox might be a problem for some—especially those who wear thick socks in winter.",
