  "pros": "Durable upper; Vibram Megagrip outsole; Still lightweight for its size; Supportive and stable ride; Increased cushioning; Improved tongue design; Still reasonably priced; Revamped heel collar",
  "cons": "Disappointing breathability; Rigidity increase; Outsole durability concerns",
  "RR_verdict": "The Speedgoat 6 aims to replicate and refine the massive success of its predecessor—and we think it stands a fair chance of doing that. We were pleased to find that it retains the versatility, grip, and stability of the previous model, but now with increased cushioning at the same weight. However, in our testing, we observed that the midsole's subpar energy return and the upper's poor ventilation render it less suitable for ultra races and diminish its versatility when compared to previous models.",
