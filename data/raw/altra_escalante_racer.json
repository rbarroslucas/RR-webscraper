  "brand": "Altra",
  "total_score": "91",
  "pros": "Durable, breathable upper; Exceptionally flexible; Minimalist, natural ride; Superior grip; Spacious toebox; Stable; Really lightweight; Authentic zero-drop design",
  "cons": "Minimal energy return; Not the best for winter; Non-gusseted tongue",
  "RR_verdict": "We think the Altra Escalante Racer is a top choice for zero-drop aficionados who favor old-school, non-plated racing flats. It boasts minimal cushioning and offers an incredibly flexible ride—all in a lightweight, spacious design. We found that its firm cushioning might not appeal to everyone, but for those opposed to bulky, maximalist shoes, it's an excellent pick.",
