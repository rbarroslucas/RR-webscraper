  "brand": "Saucony",
  "total_score": "87",
  "pros": "Insanely lightweight; Outstanding energy return from PWRRUN PB; Delivers an impressively quick and enjoyable ride; Incredibly flexible for a true natural feel; Perfect for enthusiasts of racing flats; Excellent for dynamic track workouts; Remarkable lockdown for narrow feet; Optimal for short to moderate-distance races and tempo runs",
  "cons": "Falls short in durability; Insufficient cushioning for longer distances; Would improve a lot with only a tiny bit more foam",
  "RR_verdict": "The Saucony Sinister is a bold, ultra-lightweight racer that brings back old-school racing flat vibes, yet surprises with super-shoe-like energy return thanks to its PWRRUN PB foam. We really appreciated how it's perfect for those who love the raw feel of a track spike but on the road, enjoying a run without the assistance of a carbon plate. While this unique shoe may not be as durable, has a quite narrow upper, and isn't ideal for runs exceeding 10 miles, it stands out in a sea of maximalist designs. In our lab, it provided a refreshingly natural ride that breaks the monotony of the typical rockered, high-stacked shoes.",
