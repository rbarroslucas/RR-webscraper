  "total_score": "77",
  "pros": "True zero-drop midsole; Foot-shaped, wide toebox; Excellent durability; Improved heel lockdown; Plush step-in comfort; Keeps the same price; Can be used for walking; Amazing for forefoot strikers; Improved outsole; Stable",
  "cons": "Weight gain compared to v7; Not for rearfoot strikers; Needs a better foam ASAP; Non-gusseted tongue",
  "RR_verdict": "The Altra Torin 8 took longer than expected to arrive, but we think the wait paid off—mostly. The heel lockdown is dialed in, the toebox is wide, the upper feels plush, and the grippy outsole is more durable than ever. On our runs, the midsole delivered a stable, grounded ride, though we found the foam still lacks pop and energy return. We also noted the added weight compared to version 7, which takes away some of the fun and makes it a less exciting pick for tempo sessions or fast-paced miles.",
