  "RR_verdict": "A shoe that literally launches me forward - the Brooks Launch 8! Easily, it's one of my best picks for tempo training shoes that don't break the bank. For a budget shoe, it goes above and beyond in areas of lightness, speed, and durability - something most speedsters don't possess! If you already have an easy-day and race-day shoe, this will complete your rotation. And if you want a light daily running shoe, I believe that it can fit the bill too!",
