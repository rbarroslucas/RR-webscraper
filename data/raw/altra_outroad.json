  "pros": "Great on roads and trails; Pliable upper; Amazing outsole durability; Comfy padding; Less bulky than other Altras; Low stack; Doubles as a traveling shoe; Appealing design",
  "cons": "Toebox is not Altra-wide; Breaking-in needed",
  "RR_verdict": "The Altra Outroad is a zero-drop trail shoe that seems to take the place of the Timp in the brand’s lineup: it’s a true, excellent all-rounder that proved to be reliable on almost all surfaces we tested it on. We noticed that it’s not the usual Altra when it comes to width, yet it’s extremely comfortable and perfect for short to marathon distances. Last but not least, in a world where companies seem to compete to find the longest and most confusing names, “Outroad” is very welcomed.",
