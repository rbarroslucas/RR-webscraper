  "RR_verdict": "The Adidas Pureboost 23 stands out as a versatile option for beginners and casual runners. Its design boasts a highly breathable and top-notch upper, paired with a thin-and-plush midsole, effortlessly transitioning between a running shoe and a trendy sneaker. Despite these positives, we noted the lack of cushioning and a bit of extra weight make it a favorable option mainly for those aiming for shorter, occasional runs.",
