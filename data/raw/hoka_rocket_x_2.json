  "total_score": "86",
  "pros": "Ultra-responsive PEBA foam; Long-lasting outsole with extensive heel coverage; Maximum cushioning; Superb energy return; Remarkably stable; Suitable for all foot strike types; Excellent traction; Fantastic rocker geometry",
  "cons": "Bloody narrow toebox; Heavier than the competition",
  "RR_verdict": "For years, Hoka enthusiasts have awaited the Rocket X 2, and it doesn't disappoint. Boasting an all-new, bouncy PEBA midsole, we are happy to confirm it delivers the same energy return as the world's best racing shoes. The rocker design offers a smooth, stable ride, and we found the outsole truly shines in durability and grip. However, the $250 MSRP combined with a narrow upper might not meet everyone's expectations.",
