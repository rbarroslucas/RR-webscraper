  "total_score": "86",
  "pros": "FF Blast+ ECO midsole boost energy return; Stellar value for its durability; Improved stability; Lighter than its predecessor; Rugged ASICSGRIP outsole grips well; Flexible rock plate adds some protection; Improved transitions for heel strikers; New GEL insert in the heel; Can handle some road segments",
  "cons": "Ultra-stiff construction limits hiking comfort; Heel counter feels rigid; Not for wide feet",
  "RR_verdict": "ASICS has finally given this series a much-needed revamp, and we found more to love than to criticize. In our lab tests, the Trabuco 13 delivered improved energy return, grippier traction, and enhanced stability—all while shedding some weight. The ASICSGRIP outsole impressed us with its confident grip on varied terrain, and the updated midsole injected a bouncier feel into each stride. However, the ultra-rigid heel counter and reduced flexibility might not suit everyone, especially hikers. That said, we believe this update is a step in the right direction, laying a strong foundation for future versions.",
