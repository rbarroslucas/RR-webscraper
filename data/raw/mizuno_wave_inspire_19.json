  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Embedded Wave Plate enhances stability and responsiveness; Enerzy Lite midsole delivers thick, protective cushioning; Strong grip even in wet conditions; Handles light trails with ease; X10 rubber is tough and long-lasting; Well-built upper; Perfect fit for runners with wide feet",
  "cons": "Upper lacks breathability; Fit may be too loose for narrow feet; The 12.4-mm heel drop might not suit everyone",
  "RR_verdict": "We put the Mizuno Wave Inspire 19 to the test and it really stood out in the stability category. Its well-crafted upper, exceptional grip, and durability impressed us, especially on wet surfaces, gravel roads and easy trails. However, it's best suited for those who prefer a significant heel drop, and we also noticed that the upper isn't ideal for hot weather.",
