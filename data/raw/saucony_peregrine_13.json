  "brand": "Saucony",
  "total_score": "89",
  "pros": "Cushioned midsole; Protective rock plate; Better for longer efforts than the v12; A good trail racing option; Great traction whether on ice, snow, gravel, and dirt; Mud just falls off the outsole; Comfy and airy upper; Performance-oriented fit; No heel slippage; Smooth and natural-feeling ride",
  "cons": "Debris tends to get in; Not as fast as other speedwork trail shoes; Too-firm midsole",
  "RR_verdict": "As one of the longest-running trail series, the Peregrine is among the first shoes we think about when going offroad. In our opinion, it can handle nearly anything you throw at it thanks to its tried-and-true comfort, agility, and traction. But what truly puts the v13 above its predecessors is its thicker slab of midsole foam—making it even more capable for easy days, long slow miles, and the occasional race through punishing terrains.",
