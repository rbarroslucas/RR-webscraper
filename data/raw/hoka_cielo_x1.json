  "RR_verdict": "The Cielo X1 is Hoka's second supershoe, now masterfully merging their iconic rockered geometry and plush cushioning with advanced features like PEBA foam and a carbon plate. Our lab evaluations revealed its weight could be an obstacle for advanced marathoners and 5K/10K races, yet the shoe's energetic ride and durable build won us over. Even with its premium $275 price point, the Cielo X1 shines as an exceptional racer that perfectly marries elite performance with Hoka's signature DNA.",
