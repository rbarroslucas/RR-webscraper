  "total_score": "76",
  "pros": "Still lightweight; Foam upgraded to DNA Loft; Massive value at just $100; Good heel cushion; More spacious toebox; Fantastic durability; Versatile",
  "cons": "Upper downgrade; Slight weight gain from v2; Not for forefoot strikers; Lacks grip on wet surface",
  "RR_verdict": "In our lab tests, we discovered that the Brooks Trace 3 carries forward the excellent value-oriented design of its predecessor and enhances it with superior foam, all while maintaining the same $100 retail price. Despite a slight increase in weight and a less breathable upper, we found that this shoe excels for heel strikers seeking an affordable, versatile option with a durable outsole.",
