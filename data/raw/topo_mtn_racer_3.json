  "total_score": "87",
  "pros": "Ultra-durable and grippy Vibram rubber; Wide, foot-shaped toebox; Breathable-light upper; Fully gusseted tongue; Lug pattern handles varied terrain; Secure and stable for forefoot and midfoot strikers; Great as a hiking shoe; Solid value",
  "cons": "Not a racer despite its name; Upper durability falls short; Too roomy for small or narrow feet; Lacks reflective elements",
  "RR_verdict": "The Topo MTN Racer 3 might not live up to its name as a true racer, but in our experience, it does a pretty good job as a trail shoe built for comfort and stability. We found its ultra-wide toebox perfect for natural toe splay, making it a dream for those with high-volume feet. Paired with a durable Vibram outsole, it offers superb traction across varied terrain. However, major downsides include weak upper durability and a fit that heavily favors wide, high-volume feet—leaving others with a wobbly, unstable ride.",
