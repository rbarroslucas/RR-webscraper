  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Cushioned and comfortable; Excellent grip across diverse terrains; Outstanding Vibram Megagrip outsole; Noticeably lighter than previous models; Robust and long-lasting upper; Delivers a responsive and impressively stable ride; Adaptable to multiple paces; 100% ready for ultras; Enhanced flexibility compared to previous versions",
  "cons": "Ankle collar design favors debris intrusion; Excessive foam exposure might be a concern; Not for wide feet",
  "RR_verdict": "The Hoka Mafate Speed 4, emerging as a lighter successor to its predecessor, truly impressed us in our lab. This versatile shoe adeptly navigates through a variety of trails, from rapid descents to long-distance gravel paths, thanks to its Traction Lugs and Vibram outsole. We discovered during our testing that it shines in responsiveness, grip, and comfort, making it well-suited for both training sessions and competitive trail races. However, we did notice a design flaw: the ankle collar tends to let debris into the shoe, which might be an issue for some. Despite this, we think that the Mafate Speed 4 stands out for its balanced blend of cushioning and agility.",
