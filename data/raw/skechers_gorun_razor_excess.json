  "RR_verdict": "Donning the Skechers GOrun Razor Excess is light, fast, fun, and comfortable. The hits from Skechers keep coming and the Razor line as a whole is fantastic. This Razor Excess has more of their amazing Hyper Burst midsole than past models, which provided my feet with a bit more comfort and padding for longer efforts or even daily training. Don’t be fooled though, this unicorn can toe the line on race day and carry speed through tempo workouts. It can do just about everything!",
