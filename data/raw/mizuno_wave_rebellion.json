  "pros": "Unique geometry; Exceptionally lightweight; Responsive midsole; Versatile for both tempo pace and long runs; Superior heel lock; Remarkable stability; Spacious toebox",
  "cons": "Potentially overpriced at $180; Lacks outsole durability; Thin oversized tongue",
  "RR_verdict": "The Mizuno Wave Rebellion breaks away from convention with a prominent heel cutout exposing its fiberglass Wave Plate. This lightweight, all-pace, high-stability shoe not only looks good to us, but also provides ample cushioning for those long runs. Yet, concerns about durability emerged in our lab, particularly given its near $200 price tag.",
