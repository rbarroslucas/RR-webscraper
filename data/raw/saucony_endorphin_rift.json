  "pros": "Fantastic PWRRUN PB midsole technology; Ideal for summer runs due to its breathable upper; Capable of handling muddy terrain with ease; Upper and outsole showcase incredible durability; Sufficiently cushioned for ultra-marathons; Exceptional cushion-to-weight ratio; Sock-like upper provides a fantastic fit; Excellent heel lockdown; Handles faster paces effortlessly",
  "cons": "Tongue design needs enhancement for ultras; Lugs could be slightly shorter; Price point is probably too high for some budgets",
  "RR_verdict": "The Saucony Endorphin Rift is a one-of-a-kind trail running shoe. In our lab tests, we were amazed by its combination of an energetic midsole and a breathable upper, making summer long runs feel like a breeze, all in an incredibly lightweight 9-oz package. In our experience, although it may be a bit pricey, this shoe is versatile enough to handle both short and ultra distances, wide gravel roads, and narrow singletrack trails, whether in mud or dry conditions. And its Speedroll-assisted ride makes it an outstanding choice for anyone seeking a dynamic, rockered running experience.",
