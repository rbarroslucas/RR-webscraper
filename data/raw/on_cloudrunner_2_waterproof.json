  "total_score": "66",
  "pros": "Well cushioned; Amazing reflective elements for safety; Reinforced waterproof upper; Fantastic stability; Excellent for cold, wet winters; Build quality; Doubles as a walking shoe; Reliable grip",
  "cons": "Unnecessarily heavy; Heel durability issues; Priced higher than competitors; Firm midsole",
  "RR_verdict": "The On Cloudrunner 2 Waterproof is a strong pick for runners needing a winter-ready, weather-resistant shoe, but it’s not ideal for everyone. In our tests, we found the firm midsole and heavy design may not suit those preferring lighter, softer shoes. However, we were impressed by its premium build, reliable traction, and excellent stability, making it a fantastic option for harsh weather running and walking.",
