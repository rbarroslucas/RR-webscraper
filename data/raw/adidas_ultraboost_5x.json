  "total_score": "91",
  "pros": "Works well as a casual sneaker too; Premium, high-quality materials throughout; Stretchy, roomy upper; Built-to-last durability; Best Ultraboost version to date; Stable for heel strikers; Increased stack height; Noticeable weight reduction",
  "cons": "Steep price; Ventilation falls short of expectations; Limited to slower paces; Less stack height than advertised",
  "RR_verdict": "The Adidas Ultraboost 5X delivers the revamp this series needed, combining weight reduction, a premium-knit upper, and unmatched durability. In our lab tests, we found it retains its iconic DNA while addressing past flaws, making it more runner-focused while remaining great as a casual sneaker. The UB5X feels well-cushioned and supportive, particularly for heel strikers, though it lacks the lively energy of similarly priced competitors—an issue compounded by its undeniably high price point.",
