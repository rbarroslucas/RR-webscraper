  "total_score": "81",
  "pros": "Continues to provide exceptional value at only $65; Incredibly durable outsole; Accommodates wide feet comfortably; Offers a flexible ride; Budget-friendly; Versatile enough to serve as a gym shoe; Provides substantial comfort for heel strikers; More cushion than previous versions",
  "cons": "Lacks cushioning in the forefoot area; Weighs more than v1 and v2; The upper is not durable at all",
  "RR_verdict": "At a budget-friendly $65, the Adidas Runfalcon 3 offers surprising versatility. Perfect for casual runs and stylish enough for daily wear, we found this shoe to be a real all-rounder. However, its lack of bounce and upper durability left us wanting more. In the end, we consider it a reliable option for casual or low-mileage runners seeking a cheap one-shoe-fits-all shoe.",
