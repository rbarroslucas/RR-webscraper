  "total_score": "92",
  "pros": "Perfectly balanced midsole; Ample cushioning for extended runs; Highly breathable monomesh upper; Attractively priced; Exceptionally lightweight; Suitable for racing; Grippy and long-lasting outsole; Great deal at $160 for a carbon-plated shoe",
  "cons": "Likely too narrow for some; Midsole could use more energy return; Upper could be more durable",
  "RR_verdict": "Our experience with ASICS' Magic Speed 3 was exceptionally favorable. This shoe expertly combines the FF Blast+ foam from the Novablast 4 with design elements and geometry inspired by the Metaspeed Edge+, resulting in a stellar mix of affordability and supershoe features. Priced attractively at just $160, it features a carbon plate, an impressively lightweight build, and a top-quality, breathable upper. However, while the foam provides good cushioning, it falls slightly short in terms of energy return. Also, its narrow design, though beneficial for a snug fit, might not be the most comfortable choice for runners with wider feet.",
