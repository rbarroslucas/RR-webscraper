  "RR_verdict": "The Mizuno Wave Inspire 20 is a daily trainer aimed at runners with mild overpronation that makes great use of the brand's various technologies to keep us as neutral as possible. Its cushy and responsive Enerzy foam midsole protects us with a pleasant bounce while the wave plate stabilizes our movements and propels us forward. Whether we're out for an easy recovery run or a mile-gobbling distance effort, this shoe kept us feeling comfy and supported through and through. As an added bonus, with its now plant-based plate and 90% recycled upper, Mizuno made some environmentally responsible choices with the Wave Inspire 20 that we can all get behind.",
