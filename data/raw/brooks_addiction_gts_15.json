  "brand": "Brooks",
  "total_score": "79",
  "pros": "Plenty of stability; Incredible outsole durability; Effective GuideRails technology; Accommodates custom orthotics; Grippy on most surfaces; Ideal for bigger runners; Highly breathable; Fairly priced",
  "cons": "Lacks flexibility; Quite heavy; Firm midsole",
  "RR_verdict": "The Addiction 15 excels as a niche shoe, masterfully prioritizing stability and durability—qualities crucial for severe pronators. We found that Brooks maximized these features, albeit at the expense of weight and versatility, as we found that it's heavier compared to most competitors. Nevertheless, we believe it's an outstanding choice for runners who need firm support and don't mind its massive heft.",
