  "RR_verdict": "The Scarpa Spin Planet impressed us with its cool name and bold design. During our evaluation, we really liked its highly breathable upper and the innovative tongue design that offers a secure and comfortable fit. We also found that this door-to-trail shoe excels in stability and grip, making it suitable for various conditions. However, we were disappointed by the heavier weight and lack of energy return—clear areas that could benefit from significant improvement in future versions.",
