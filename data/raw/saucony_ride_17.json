  "cons": "Tapered toebox; Subpar breathability; Could be lighter",
  "RR_verdict": "The Saucony Ride 17 is more than just a minor update—it's a significant overhaul, especially with the all-new midsole that enhances energy return and responsiveness. In our lab tests, we were impressed by its superb durability, remarkable stability and the spacious upper, perfectly accommodating wide feet for a superbly comfortable fit. Despite its strengths, the Ride 17 has some limitations. It remains somewhat heavy for its stack height, and, in our lab tests, the new mesh upper fell really short of our expectations for breathability.",
