  "brand": "Nike",
  "total_score": "87",
  "pros": "Fits true to size; Grip is great in dry conditions; Secure lacing and lockdown; Responsive; Excellent heel-loop; Durable construction; Air Zoom unit makes a difference; Great ground feel; Amazing colorways",
  "cons": "Tight in the toe box; Not enough cushioning for longer runs; Lack of grip on wet trails; Not much protection underfoot; Could be lighter",
  "RR_verdict": "I noticed that the sixth version of the Nike Terra Kiger doesn’t try to change hugely from the Terra Kiger 5, except in a few ways. The fastest trail shoe from Nike, the Terra Kiger 6 feels lower to the ground, and more form-fitting than its ancestor, making it better for those race days, but less capable of taking me long distances in my runs.",
