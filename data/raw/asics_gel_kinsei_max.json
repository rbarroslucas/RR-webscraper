  "total_score": "83",
  "pros": "Deep, plush cushioning; Rocker geometry for smooth transitions; Excellent for cold weather; Amazing stability; High-quality upper; Ideal for heel strikers; Can be used as a sneaker or travel shoe",
  "cons": "Heavyweight build; Not the most spacious toebox; High retail price; Low energy return",
  "RR_verdict": "The ASICS Gel Kinsei Max is massive, comfort-loaded, and unapologetically heavy. In our runs, it felt more like a lifestyle-performance hybrid than a solid daily trainer. We were surprised by its colossal GEL piece in the heel, which offered cloud-plush landings, but we think that the high weight and steep price tag make it a hard sell. In our opinion, it’s best suited for casual runners who want a bold-looking, comfortable option and don’t mind the extra heft underfoot.",
