  "total_score": "87",
  "pros": "Responsive and well-cushioned midsole; Good for speedwork; Excellent impact dampening; Can gobble up miles; Provides great stability; Secure and comfortable lockdown; Grippy and durable outsole capable of mild trails",
  "cons": "Upper durability leaves much to be desired; Break-in period required",
  "RR_verdict": "The Ride 16 is a veritable workhorse from Saucony that does everything we expect from a daily trainer with the underfoot feeling of a performance shoe. What’s more, the shoe’s improved upper provided us with a snug and secure lockdown while the robust platform kept us sure-footed and stable throughout our test runs. While first impressions aren’t the shoe’s strong suit, bearing with the Ride 16 yields a ride that’s smooth, peppy, and comfortable whether we took it for a speedy 5K or a long and slow stretch.",
