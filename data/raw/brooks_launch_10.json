  "pros": "Amazing value; Incredibly light; Comfortable upper; Durable outsole that stands the test of time; Fun and responsive ride; Works well for both easy and fast-paced runs; Balanced midsole",
  "cons": "Breathability needs improvement; Foam becomes too stiff in cold winter temperatures; Lacks grip for slippery roads",
  "RR_verdict": "The Brooks Launch 10 stands out as a light, fun daily trainer at a reasonable price of only $110. Equipped with a well-cushioned midsole and a durable outsole, we believe it's capable of handling almost every pace. Although there's room to enhance breathability and the foam can become too firm in cold temperatures, we think these minor setbacks don't overshadow the incredible value of this versatile running shoe.",
