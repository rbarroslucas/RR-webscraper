  "total_score": "80",
  "pros": "Upper crafted entirely from recycled materials; Ideal for beginners; Versatile for both hiking and walking; Superb Vibram outsole with effective Traction Lugs; Attractive pricing for its features; Integrated rock plate for underfoot protection; Secure heel lockdown; Really cushioned",
  "cons": "Only suited for mild to moderate trails; Needs a reduction in weight; Not suited for fast paces",
  "RR_verdict": "We love the Merrell Nova 3 as it stands out as a versatile shoe catering to a wide range of runners and outdoor activities. Its environmentally friendly, durable upper complements a generously cushioned midsole, ensuring comfort and support for extended adventures, be it running, walking, or hiking. We were particularly impressed by the Vibram outsole, which offers exceptional grip and durability. However, the shoe's weight is a tad heavier than ideal, and at times, its stiffness was more noticeable than we'd like. Nonetheless, considering its fair price point and the array of impressive features it offers, we believe the Nova 3 is a solid choice.",
