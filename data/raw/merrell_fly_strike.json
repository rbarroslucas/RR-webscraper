  "pros": "Great ventilation; Durable and cozy upper; Ultra-plush tongue; Reasonably priced; Suitable for casual wear; Works well for walking and hiking; Can be used as a go-to travel shoe",
  "cons": "Excessively high drop; Only suited for heel strikers; Lacks outsole durability",
  "RR_verdict": "The Merrell Fly Strike is an affordable trail shoe that shines for walking and hiking. However, in our lab tests, it fell short for running. We found that its bizarre 17-mm drop is a mismatch for many, enough to dismay barefoot aficionados, also resulting in a forefoot that's too thin and skimps on cushioning. However, its great breathability and cozy upper impressed us, making it a good pick for a wide range of outdoor adventures.",
