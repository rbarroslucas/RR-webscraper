  "brand": "HOKA",
  "total_score": "85",
  "pros": "A true supershoe for trails; Ultra-grippy and durable Vibram outsole; Fantastic energy return from PEBA foam; Versatile for both long runs and ultra races; Stability improvements; Shields from debris effectively; Premium MATRYX upper; Designed to dominate ultra-distance events; Secure fit",
  "cons": "Sky-high price tag; Heavier than the Tecton X 2; Absolutely not for wide feet; New ankle gaiter may not work for everyone",
  "RR_verdict": "We found that the HOKA Tecton X 3 finally earns its status as a trail supershoe, but it comes with a superprice. In our lab tests, we were impressed by its state-of-the-art materials—Vibram Megagrip for outstanding traction, a MATRYX upper for durability, and a PEBA midsole that fuels every stride with amazing energy return. We also discovered improved stability and grip, making it a solid choice for any race. On the flip side, it remains a narrow fit, the new ankle gaiter won’t suit everyone, and it gained some weight compared to its predecessor.",
