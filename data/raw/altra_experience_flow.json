  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Broad appeal for various runners; Exceptionally light; Comfortable, durable upper; Spacious foot-shaped toebox; Ideal as a travel shoe; Superior stability; Highly breathable; Fairly priced",
  "cons": "Lacks energy return; Not for fast paces at all; Non-gusseted tongue",
  "RR_verdict": "Altra is widening its appeal by introducing 4-mm drop options alongside its classic zero-drop lineup—and we believe they've struck gold with the Experience Flow. Despite its uninspiring EVA midsole, we discovered that it excels as a daily trainer, offering an impressive balance of stability, durability, and comfort—all while maintaining a surprisingly low weight for its stack height.",
