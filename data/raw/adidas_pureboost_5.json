  "total_score": "83",
  "pros": "Features the new Light Boost foam; Breathable upper; Spacious toebox vs. most competitors; Ideal for heel strikers; Much lighter than Pureboost 23; Solid durability; Semi-gusseted tongue offers top lockdown; Flexible build suits casual use; Reflective elements",
  "cons": "Low toebox height; Not for long runs; Angled heel design not for everyone",
  "RR_verdict": "We think the Adidas Pureboost 5 is a solid upgrade that offers great value. In our lab tests, we found it’s 20% lighter than the last version and feels more lively underfoot. We were impressed by the breathable upper, new Light Boost foam, and how well it works for casual runs, gym sessions, and daily use. However, it may fall short for runners needing extra cushioning or those who land on the midfoot or forefoot.",
