  "brand": "Altra",
  "total_score": "85",
  "pros": "Incredibly roomy toebox; Authentic zero-drop design; Extremely cushy and soft midsole; Superb all-around durability; Cozy upper; Remarkably stable; Ideal for long runs",
  "cons": "Limited ventilation; Tongue not gusseted; Still a bit heavy",
  "RR_verdict": "The VIA Olympus 2 marks a notable leap forward from Altra, enhancing cushioning and durability while maintaining the beloved features of its predecessor—spacious fit, slightly rockered geometry, and unparalleled comfort. We were thrilled by its updated plush midsole, though we noted it's still on the heavier side and the tongue could benefit from a gusset. Despite these minor points, we are convinced that for zero-drop runners seeking a reliable companion for long runs, the VIA Olympus 2 is unmatched.",
