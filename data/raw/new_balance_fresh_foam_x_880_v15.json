  "pros": "Affordable max-stack option; Secure and comfortable lockdown; Rockered geometry; Plush tongue enhances comfort; No heel slippage whatsoever; Amazing for long runs; Durable yet comfy upper; Fairly priced; Stable ride",
  "cons": "Much heavier than previous version; Not the best for walking or casual use; Fresh Foam X feels firmer than expected; Outsole durability is now a real concern",
  "RR_verdict": "The New Balance Fresh Foam X 880 v15 has undergone a bold transformation—keeping only its price unchanged. In our lab tests, we discovered a thicker, firmer midsole that enhances cushioning but also adds noticeable weight. The outsole now has less rubber coverage, raising durability concerns. We found that this shift moves the 880 away from its balanced roots and into max-stack territory, a change that won’t suit everyone—it now feels more like a budget-friendly 1080!",
