  "pros": "Surprinsingly light for its size; Improved energy return; Maximalist cushioning from heel to toe; Smooth, natural-feeling rocker; Innovative inside-out upper construction; Solid ventilation; Handles long runs with ease; Good grip; Premium quality materials",
  "cons": "Pricier than most competitors; Tight fit and tapered toebox; Upper and outsole durability concerns",
  "RR_verdict": "Third time’s a charm for the Aero Glide 3, as it finally earns a top spot in the maximalist category. We tested it in the lab and out on the road and found it lighter, bouncier, and more stable than before. In our view, Salomon landed a great mix of comfort, cushioning, and low weight, making it an easy pick for long runs. Still, the tapered fit may be too tight for many, and we think the upper and outsole could fall short in durability.",
