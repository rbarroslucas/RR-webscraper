  "brand": "Skechers",
  "total_score": "91",
  "pros": "Maximalist yet affordable; Durable, grippy Goodyear outsole; Plush upper; Machine washable for convenience; Doubles as a walking shoe; Fantastic at easy paces; Rocker-enhanced transitions; CO2-infused midsole",
  "cons": "Noticeably heavy; Struggles at faster paces; Lacks energy return",
  "RR_verdict": "The Skechers GO RUN Max Road 6 shines for runners who prefer a maximalist shoe for easy-paced miles, jogs, or even just walking. In our experience, its substantial weight and towering stack reduce versatility, but it makes up for this with a comfortable upper, a reliable Goodyear outsole, and an impressively affordable price. We also appreciated its CO2-infused midsole, which also performs better for slow paces than for faster efforts.",
