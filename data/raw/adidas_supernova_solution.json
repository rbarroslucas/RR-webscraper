In our experience, it combines the comfort of an average daily trainer with just the right touch of support, delivering a balanced and smooth ride. We were also impressed by its breathable, comfort-driven upper. While we wished for a gusseted tongue and Continental rubber, the Solution remains a well-priced, mild-stability option that provides a reliable answer for everyday running.",
