  "RR_verdict": "Wow, these are lightning-fast! I found the ASICS Metaspeed Edge the twin sibling to the recently released Metaspeed Sky. It struck me as suitable for fast cadence runners, whereas the Sky appeared ideal for long-stride runners. These ultralight kicks pack a stiff carbon plate between the bouncy midsole, delivering powerful propulsion and daring speed with each of my steps. If you’re looking to win your next race, toe the line in the Metaspeed Edge!",
