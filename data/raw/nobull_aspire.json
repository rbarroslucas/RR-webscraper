  "RR_verdict": "We found the NOBULL Aspire (previously known as Knit Runner) to be a comfy athleisure /jogging option with an eye-catching design. It may be struggling with competition in the performance running shoe segment, but we had cozy rides during our shorter daily miles and walks. If unique looks and comfort are a priority for you, this could be a worthy investment.",
