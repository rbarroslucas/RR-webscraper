  "RR_verdict": "The Xero Shoes Scrambler Low shines as one of the most versatile, feature-rich minimalist trail shoes we’ve tested. We were impressed by its grippy Michelin outsole, excelling across varied terrains, and its ultra-flexible, adventure-ready construction that delivers a smooth, natural ride. In our lab tests, the anatomic toebox promoted excellent toe splay, ensuring outstanding comfort on uneven surfaces. On the flip side, its substantial weight, premium price, and relatively high stack height may raise concerns for some barefoot-style enthusiasts.",
