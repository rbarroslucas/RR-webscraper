  "pros": "Functions well as a casual sneaker; Comfortable for all-day wear; Suitable for wide feet; Budget-friendly at only $75; Appealing aesthetic; Eco-friendly; Stable for heel strikers",
  "cons": "Only for casual runs; Offers limited arch support; Insufficient forefoot cushioning",
  "RR_verdict": "The Adidas Racer TR21 doesn't quite match the expectations set by its name. It isn't quite a racing shoe, but rather a hybrid between a comfortable everyday sneaker and a heavy running shoe. Affordable and flexible, this shoe is crafted with the beginner in mind, making it perfect for low-intensity jogs or walks in the park. However, we think if you're in the market for a genuine racing shoe or if you're a midfoot or forefoot striker, this may not be the ideal fit.",
