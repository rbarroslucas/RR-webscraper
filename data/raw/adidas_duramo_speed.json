  "pros": "Awesome value; Ideal for midfoot strikers; Well-cushioned; Excellent breathability; Durable outsole; Lightweight; Spacious toebox",
  "cons": "Somewhat limited versatility; Lacing system; Suboptimal for heel strikers",
  "RR_verdict": "Crafting a budget-friendly shoe that excels in multiple areas is challenging, yet we think Adidas has done a remarkable job with the Duramo Speed. It offers a lightweight ride with superb breathability, complemented by a durable outsole and a solid Lightstrike midsole. While it might be a bit stiffer than we'd like, and the 6.0-mm drop isn't for everyone, we believe it's an excellent choice for those seeking great value.",
