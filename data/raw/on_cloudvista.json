  "pros": "Works great as a hybrid shoe; Grippy and durable outsole; Fun at high speeds; Highly breathable; Rockered for smooth heel-to-toe transitions.; Secure lockdown; No heel rub; No Lace bite; Environmentally friendly upper; Suitable for walking or hiking; Stylish for a trail shoe",
  "cons": "Not for technical trails; Not a distance shoe; Doesn’t accommodate wide feet; Midsole catches debris",
  "RR_verdict": "Unassuming at first glance, the On Cloudvista is actually a highly versatile shoe that can comfortably switch from road to trail without skipping a beat. Its flexibilty, rockered design, and energetic midsole made our shorter test runs fast, fun, and forgiving on the foot. What's more, we found the Cloudvista comfortable enough for walking or hiking without feeling too blocky, and its upper made from mostly recycled material is stylish to boot.",
