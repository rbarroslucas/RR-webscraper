  "total_score": "90",
  "pros": "Amazing build quality; Excellent stability; Remarkably lightweight; Cheaper than most On models; Reliable lockdown; Great for forefoot strikers",
  "cons": "Heel padding may wear quickly; Needs better breathability; Likely too firm for most; Not grippy enough on wet",
  "RR_verdict": "We found the Cloudsurfer Next to be a sturdy, well-constructed addition to On’s lineup—tailored for midfoot and forefoot strikers who favor a firm, stable ride. In our lab tests, its narrow build and low drop provided agility, making it a reliable choice for runners with a neutral gait. While it doesn’t deliver the cloud-like experience its name suggests, we appreciated the high-quality materials and streamlined design, and we think it's a good option for those who prefer a firmer, responsive daily trainer.",
