  "brand": "Adidas",
  "total_score": "85",
  "pros": "Exceptionally affordable; Comfortable for walking; Ideal for heel strikers; Performs well in cold climates; Cushy upper material; Ultraboost-inspired heel design; Ortholite insole; Improved heel design",
  "cons": "Shockingly poor durability; Insufficient forefoot cushioning; Firm midsole; Awful traction",
  "RR_verdict": "The Runfalcon 5 is a budget-friendly running shoe that comes with significant limitations. While we appreciated the improved stability and the comfortably padded upper, we found that durability was a major letdown that makes it a tough sell for those needing a long-lasting shoe. However, if durability isn’t your top priority, this shoe still offers a wallet-friendly, no-frills design for casual use.",
