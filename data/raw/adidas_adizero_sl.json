  "pros": "Spacious upper; Durable outsole; Highly breathable mesh; Surprisingly light; Stable for being a neutral daily trainer; Superb grip; Great value; Suitable for track workouts",
  "cons": "Lightstrike feels like a brick; Low energy return; Heel is extremely narrow",
  "RR_verdict": "Adidas' latest foray into the daily trainer game is the Adizero SL, which borrows design elements from the brand's premium lineup. At $120, it boasts a feathery weight, top-notch stability and fantastic breathability. The catch? The heel is on the narrow side, which might not sit well with heel strikers. Plus, even though it has a puck of Lightstrike Pro in the forefoot, we found the foam is quite firm overall and lacks energy return.",
