  "total_score": "89",
  "pros": "Sweet marshmallowy ride; Feels surprisingly stable underfoot; Great at gobbling up miles; Generously padded and extremely comfortable; Snug performance-style fit; No break-in period needed; Sleek and sustainable design",
  "cons": "Lackluster breathability; Not for wide feet; Not responsive enough for high speeds; Budget buster",
  "RR_verdict": "Nimbus, from the Latin for rain, is usually used in reference to storm clouds that carry rain, sleet, or snow. Running in the ASICS Gel Nimbus 25, however, is anything but stormy. Its generously padded upper cozily secures our foot in place while the truly cloud-like midsole provides a pillowy and bouncy ride that brings the fun to our daily runs. It’s certainly worth a splurge if comfort is top of the priority list when it comes to daily trainers.",
