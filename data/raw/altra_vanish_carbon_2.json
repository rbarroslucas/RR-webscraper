  "brand": "Altra",
  "total_score": "90",
  "pros": "Ideal for midfoot strikers; Unique racing shoe; Anatomically shaped toebox; Superior breathability; Full-length carbon plate; Excellent for tempo training too; Amazing tongue; Significant upgrade from v1",
  "cons": "Insufficient energy return; Not a real zero-drop shoe; Durability concerns; High price tag",
  "RR_verdict": "The Vanish Carbon 2 signifies a major progression from its previous version, with enhancements all across the board. Although there's still room for Altra to improve the energy return to achieve supershoe status, we were captivated by its superb upper, curved carbon plate and extensive toe splay. These qualities, together with the low-drop geometry, establish it as a fantastic option for forefoot and midfoot strikers looking for a comfortable, yet expensive, racing shoe.",
