  "total_score": "79",
  "pros": "Ultra-bouncy incrediRUN foam; Ideal for slow long runs; PWRRUN+ insole adds comfort; Wide, stable midsole; Snappy for forefoot and midfoot strikers; Much better than the Kinvara Pro; Comfortable, breathable upper; Amazing lockdown",
  "cons": "Dull, firm-as-a-brick PWRRUN foam; Narrow toebox; Heavier than key rivals; Low rubber coverage",
  "RR_verdict": "The Endorphin Trainer marks a step forward for Saucony in the ultra-competitive supertrainer category, but we think it still lags behind top-tier rivals. We were impressed by its breathable-and-comfortable upper and ultra-bouncy IncrediRUN foam, which felt amazing on our runs. However, the firm PWRRUN layer and heavy build made our runs less enjoyable, especially at faster paces. It may work well for Saucony fans seeking a premium training shoe, but we believe most runners will prefer a more refined competitor.",
