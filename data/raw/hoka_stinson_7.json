  "total_score": "85",
  "pros": "Works great as a hybrid shoe; Massive stack provides excellent cushioning; Responsive midsole; Wide platform for underfoot stability; Gobbles up miles with ease; Secure heel hold and midfoot lockdown; Well padded and comfortable; Above average breathability; Mild rocker geometry; Consistent performance between warm and cold weather",
  "cons": "Too heavy for tempo sessions; Not for wide feet; Overall issues with durability; Flared heel tab scoops debris into the shoe",
  "RR_verdict": "It may look like a trail version of Hoka’s Bondi series, but we found the Stinson 7 to be in a category all of its own. This road-to-trail shoe shows us what great cushioning is all about, with a ride that feels protective and soft even when running over unforgiving terrain. If one can look past its disturbing weight, The Stinson 7 is a comfortable all-rounder that’s ideal for long slow distances or recovery days.",
