  "pros": "Excellent impact dampening; Propulsive nylon speedboard; Smooth rolling ride; Can go the distance; Feels stable underfoot; Secure and comfy lockdown; Luxuriously padded tongue; Roomy toebox; Sleek and sustainably made upper",
  "cons": "Higher than advertised drop; Stiff speedboard feels apparent at low speeds; Pricey at $180; Midsole voids catch debris",
  "RR_verdict": "This third edition of the Cloudstratus by On is a daily trainer that takes comfort seriously! Our test runs were a pleasure over all distances thanks to its high quality and generously padded upper, the roomy toebox, and the responsive yet protective cushioning. It also looks great to boot! All this doesn’t come cheap, however, with its $180 price tag putting the Cloudstratus 3 at the more premium end of the daily trainer spectrum.",
