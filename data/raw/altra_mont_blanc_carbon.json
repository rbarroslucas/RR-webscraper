  "cons": "Limited energy return; Priced high",
  "RR_verdict": "We found the Altra Mont Blanc Carbon to be a fantastic carbon-plated racing shoe for trails, distinct from its competitors. It boasts a zero-drop midsole, a flat-and-flexible carbon plate, and ample room for your toes. During our tests, we appreciated the comfortable and high-quality upper coupled with the excellent Vibram Megagrip outsole. However, we think it falls short as a true supershoe because the midsole lacks sufficient energy return, and we found the price to be on the higher side.",
