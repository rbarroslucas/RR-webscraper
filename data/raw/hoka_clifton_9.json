  "RR_verdict": "While you’d be forgiven to think that Clifton’s popularity is just the result of TikTok hype, we argue that there’s a deep-rooted heritage behind this reliable daily workhorse. This updated ninth edition is a masterclass in how not to mess with success, and we think it's the right approach. It’s now snappy, better fitting, and more fun—it's just a better shoe overall. Underneath, however, is still that unmistakably Clifton feel that we know and love.",
