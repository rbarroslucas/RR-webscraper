  "RR_verdict": "The Adidas Solarboost 5 marks a notable shift, replacing Boost foam with new Light Boost. While maintaining moderate cushioning and a firm feel underfoot—diverging from plush, maximalist trends—it impressed us with excellent stability and comfort. However, its upper could use more ventilation, we think it's still a bit heavy. Overall, we found the Solarboost 5 to be a solid, fairly-priced choice for runners prioritizing support.",
