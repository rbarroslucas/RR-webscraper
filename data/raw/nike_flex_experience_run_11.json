  "RR_verdict": "You really cannot ask much from a $70 shoe, yet the Nike Flex Experience Run 11 manages to shine somehow. Its simple design may not catch a lot of eyes on the streets, but we couldn't deny that this multi-purpose trainer definitely caught the attention of non-runners, new runners, and even some “barefoot” runners alike. Basically, if you're after an entry-level shoe that punches well above its weight, we believe this is it.",
