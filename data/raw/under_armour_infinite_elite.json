  "brand": "Under Armour",
  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Deep, impact-absorbing cushioning; Plush-and-cozy knit upper; Top stability; Upgraded HOVR+ foam; Premium-quality materials; Snug and secure lockdown; Doubles as a super-cushioned walking shoe; Great durability",
  "cons": "Noticeably heavy underfoot; Poor breathability; Only for easy paces; Not for wide feet",
  "RR_verdict": "Under Armour finally brings serious cushioning with the Infinite Elite. The HOVR+ foam provides a smooth, stable ride, and it’s paired with a premium upper that feels awesome on foot. However, we found it heavy, and the lack of breathability makes it less ideal for warm weather. In our view, it’s a solid choice for recovery runs and relaxed miles, but runners seeking a lighter shoe with better airflow might still want to explore other options.",
