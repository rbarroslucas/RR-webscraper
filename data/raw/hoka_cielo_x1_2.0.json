  "brand": "HOKA",
  "total_score": "89",
  "pros": "Much lighter than v1; Plush and responsive PEBA foam; Top-tier breathability; Forked plate adds heel flex; Comfort-focused heel padding; Outsole durability is not a concern; Improved upper and laces; Works well from 5K to the marathon; Premium TPEE insole",
  "cons": "Pricier than most rivals; Rocker can feel too aggressive; Narrow-fitting upper",
  "RR_verdict": "We believe the HOKA Cielo X1 2.0 is a major leap forward from its predecessor, solving its biggest flaws with a breathable upper and a much lighter build. In our lab tests, we found the dual-layer PEBA midsole delivers a soft-and-springy ride that feels powerfully energetic. The ultra-rockered shape gave us a forward-driving sensation during our runs, though it won’t suit everyone. While it’s far from the most stable, affordable or roomy supershoe out there, we’re convinced it now has the firepower to go head-to-head with the top performers in the game.",
