  "pros": "Exceptional all-around durability; Comfortable, plush midsole; Endless cushioning; Incredibly fun ride; Reliable traction; Versatile; Flexible despite huge stack; Well-designed rocker; Stretchy knit upper; Big reflective Mizuno logo",
  "cons": "Limited heel stability; Rock-catching outsole; Overheats in summer",
  "RR_verdict": "The supertrainer market is hot right now, and we believe that Mizuno has really upped the ante with a dopamine-boosting shoe that's as enjoyable as it is effective. It pairs a unique sock-like upper with a massive, cloud-like midsole for an exceptional blend of comfort and cushioning—all at a fair price. However, it does struggle with breathability and stability due to a flexible heel counter—yet, in our experience, these aren't dealbreakers, and it still earns high marks from us.",
