  "RR_verdict": "Now in its 21st iteration, the Adidas Ultraboost may have wowed runners with its style and durability, but I noticed that it's becoming more and more like a lifestyle shoe than a running shoe. But its strength is what makes it a standout - it literally swallowed miles and miles of pounding on the pavement during wear tests. It may not be the fastest, lightest shoe, but if you want loads of pop, it's THE shoe.",
