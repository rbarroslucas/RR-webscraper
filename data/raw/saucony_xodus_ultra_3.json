  "total_score": "83",
  "pros": "More cushioning!; Plush and energetic midsole; Versatile across various terrains; Doubles as a hiking shoe; Highly breathable upper; Ready for ultras; Non-intrusive rock plate; Stable despite increased stack; Unique PWRRUN+ footbed",
  "cons": "Lacks reflective elements; Weight increase; Reduced agility",
  "RR_verdict": "Saucony keeps tweaking the Xodus Ultra, with the third version being the most cushioned and widest to date. We really appreciated its performance across various terrains and the increased cushioning for enhanced comfort and energy return. However, it has lost some agility and gained weight. Our tests also indicated greater amounts of PWRRUN PB and an improved upper, solidifying its role as a versatile trail shoe.",
