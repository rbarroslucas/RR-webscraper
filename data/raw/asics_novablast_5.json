  "total_score": "92",
  "pros": "Improved energy return with all-new foam; Plushiest foam in a Novablast yet; Keeps the same price as v4; Higher stack height for extra cushioning; Enhanced flexibility; Lighter than its predecessor; Best Novablast ever for wide feet; Exceptional weight-to-cushion balance; Works for short, medium and long runs",
  "cons": "Lacks grip on wet surfaces; Breathability could be improved; Toebox durability",
  "RR_verdict": "The Novablast 5 takes ASICS’ best-seller to new heights—literally and figuratively. We found it lighter, softer, and bouncier, with improved flexibility and a more responsive feel underfoot. The price remains unchanged, offering excellent value with significant updates. While traction remains its weakest aspect, the ride is undeniably fun and surprisingly stable, making it a perfect choice for runners craving a blend of plush cushioning, versatility, and comfort.",
