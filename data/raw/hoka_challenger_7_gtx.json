  "brand": "HOKA",
  "total_score": "78",
  "pros": "Fully waterproof and winter-ready; Secure lockdown thanks to the gusseted tongue; Amazing stability; Provides a comfortable ride on roads and easy trails; Ideal for long runs; Generous CMEVA cushioning underfoot; Surprisingly lightweight given its stack height; Just $15 more than the regular version",
  "cons": "Lacks reflective elements; Potentially too stiff for hiking for some users; Higher heel-to-toe drop than anticipated; Ultra-tapered toebox",
  "RR_verdict": "The Hoka Challenger 7, already a fantastic all-terrain shoe, gets a solid Gore-Tex version, making it a go-to for wet conditions while keeping your feet dry. The trade-off? An additional $15 and 1.1 oz in weight, a fair exchange for those needing waterproof capabilities. In our tests, we noticed that it's really stiff and retains the same tapered toebox, which might not suit all runners. Yet, for those seeking a versatile, all-weather shoe, we think the Challenger 7 GTX offers a compelling blend of features and value with a cushioned, maximalist midsole.",
