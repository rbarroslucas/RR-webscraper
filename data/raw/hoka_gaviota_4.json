  "pros": "Superior comfort; Incredibly protective underfoot; Very smooth ride; Plenty of stability; Breathable mesh; Easy, effective lacing; Great for long-distances; Durable outsole; Double as a walker",
  "cons": "Requires some breaking-in; A bit expensive; Heavy",
  "RR_verdict": "High-stacked and massive, the HOKA Gaviota line has always been synonymous with huge cushioning and stability for overpronators. And now that it’s reached the 4th version, it keeps delivering. Second to none when it comes to comfort and underfoot protection, we still find this shoe is at home on both easy, short efforts, and very long training runs. We still find it an excellent choice for recovery days and even walking.",
