  "total_score": "84",
  "pros": "Remarkably comfortable and flexible; Outsole showcases ultra-durability; Enough cushion for heel strikers; Stable; Functions well as both a running and walking shoe; Amazing value; A great pick for Under Armour enthusiasts",
  "cons": "Falls short in breathability; Heel lockdown leaves room for improvement; Midsole could use more bounce and feels somewhat firm",
  "RR_verdict": "Under Armour’s Charged Assert 9 might not be the speediest in the UA lineup, but in our opinion, it shines as a sturdy, stable ride with a firm yet flexible midsole. While it might not be our go-to for long distance or tempo training, we strongly believe it could be your reliable gym or cross-training companion. And we're impressed by the outsole longevity, truly standing the test of time.",
