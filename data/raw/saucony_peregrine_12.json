  "RR_verdict": "The minimal drop trail shoe is a versatile all-rounder for someone who wants that go-anywhere, do-anything shoe. With nice features like a solid outsole and rock plate, the Peregrine 12 really impressed me with being a comfortable, reliable option for tempo work as well as long runs on the trails. Not to mention that it feels so light and well-ventilated!",
