  "pros": "Versatile; Excellent outsole rubber coverage; Cushioned for heel strikers; Wider than other Salomons; Efficiently designed rocker; Lightweight despite broad size; Comfortable upper",
  "cons": "Somewhat overpriced; Forefoot cushioning insufficient; Non-gusseted tongue",
  "RR_verdict": "We found the Salomon Aero Glide to be an impressive neutral daily trainer—ideal for heel strikers with its high drop and notable heel cushioning. In our lab tests, we really liked its massive rubber coverage on the outsole and the breathable upper, paired with a subtly rockered ride. However, we noted a few drawbacks: the forefoot lacks sufficient cushioning, and the price point is slightly higher compared to its competitors.",
