  "total_score": "92",
  "pros": "Extremely lightweight; Well-cushioned for long runs; Works well across various paces; Specifically designed for triathlons; Unique design; Breathable and comfortable upper; Long-lasting outsole; Suitable for sock-free running; Excellent value at $130",
  "cons": "Limited energy return; Tongue might be too thin for some; Not the best for heel strikers",
  "RR_verdict": "The ASICS Noosa Tri 15 keeps its crazy, head-turning design while adding much-wanted features like enhanced FF Blast cushioning and a stable ride that we really enjoyed. Retaining the best elements of its predecessor, it naturally evolves as a versatile speedster without tacking on extra weight. Priced at $130, we consider it stands as a solid choice for both training and racing, though the absence of a carbon plate and a narrow heel might be drawbacks for some runners and triathletes.",
