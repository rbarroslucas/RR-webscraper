  "pros": "Immaculate lockdown; Good responsiveness; Plenty of ground feel; Confident on moderate trails and steep downhills; Smooth and stable ride; Can hold its own for speedwork; Comfy and breathable upper; Best for daily miles, longer efforts, and even road runs!",
  "cons": "Forget about hard trails; Thin under forefoot; Runs a little bit narrow",
  "RR_verdict": "All beefed-up—that’s perhaps the simplest way to describe the 5th edition of the Sense Ride after our analysis. With its soft cushioning, protective ride, secure lockdown, and improved traction, we found this Salomon favorite became an even better all-around, all-terrain trainer that especially excels on moderate trails.",
