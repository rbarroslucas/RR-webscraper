  "brand": "Brooks",
  "total_score": "83",
  "pros": "Revamped nitrogen-injected midsole; Great upper breathability; Still fairly priced; Snug and secure fit; Improved for heel strikers; Agile and nimble ride; Works for daily miles and speed workouts; Improved stability",
  "cons": "Price increase from v10; Low-volume toebox; Firm ride; Minor weight gain",
  "RR_verdict": "The Launch 11 stays true to its heritage with a lightweight feel and a go-fast design we really liked. We were impressed by the responsive DNA Flash midsole that gave each stride a lively push, especially during faster sessions. Still, we found unexpected trade-offs—reduced flexibility, a heavier build, and a price increase that edges away from its budget-friendly appeal. We believe Brooks improved the tech here, but the soul of the Launch starts to feel slightly at risk.",
