  "RR_verdict": "The Puma Velocity Nitro 3, building on its predecessors' success, truly impressed us in our lab tests with its natural feel and exceptional PumaGrip outsole. Featuring a durable upper alongside the fantastic cushioning—all packaged in a surprisingly light frame—this trainer simply stands out. However, we also noticed some drawbacks during testing. The narrow forefoot and the firmer EVA carrier foam slightly dampened the ride for us. Despite these minor issues, at just $135, we're convinced it's a steal, making it a top pick for runners seeking a neutral daily trainer.",
