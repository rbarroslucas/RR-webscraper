  "RR_verdict": "A lifestyle shoe and a running shoe for $60? Take both in the Adidas Runfalcon 2.0! In our testing, we found it very suitable for casual runners and beginners who don't run more than 10 miles. But if you plan to take it out on fast-paced runs or long hauls out on the road, we say consider another shoe.",
