  "pros": "Ultra-cushioned for high mileage; Incredible stability; Ideal for heel-heavy footstrikes; Built to last; Comfortable PWRRUN+ insole; Great for cold weather; Reflective touches for low-light runs; PWRRUN PB top layer",
  "cons": "Lacks energy return; Narrow toebox; Breathability falls below average; This is not a Kinvara!",
  "RR_verdict": "We think the Saucony Kinvara Pro tries to blend max-cushion comfort with carbon-plated propulsion but doesn’t quite deliver. On our runs, it felt sluggish and stiff—mainly due to the bottom layer of PWRRUN EVA foam. We also found the toebox extremely narrow in our lab measurements, making it a poor fit for long-distance efforts. However, we were impressed by its top durability, maximalist cushioning, and surprising stability. Still, we find it hard to recommend this shoe over other supertrainers.",
