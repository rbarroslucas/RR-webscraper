  "pros": "Exceptional grip on all surfaces; Fantastic cushioning; Competitively priced; Responsive carbon plate; Adapts well to all paces; Enhanced knit upper; Ideal for tempo workouts; Great at navigating tight turns",

  "RR_verdict": "The PUMA Deviate Nitro 3 is a great choice for runners who want a little extra excitement in their tempo training. We discovered that this shoe comes with a carbon plate similar to those used in racing shoes, offering excellent energy return, traction, and cushioning, all at a very reasonable price. In our assessment, while there is still room for improvement in breathability, outsole durability, and weight, the overall update is clearly positive.",
