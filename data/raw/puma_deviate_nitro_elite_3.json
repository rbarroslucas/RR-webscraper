  "cons": "Not the best for heel strikers; Durability concerns; Lacks stability for some runners",
  "RR_verdict": "We found the Puma Deviate Nitro Elite 3 to be a significant upgrade from its predecessor—faster, lighter, and impressively responsive. For us, it's a real supershoe contender with its explosive bounce. While the lack of stability might be a major drawback for heel strikers, we think it's ideal for runners craving agility and speed. In our lab tests, the enhanced Nitro Elite cushioning and lightweight design stood out, and we believe it offers superior value for its price compared to other supershoes. On top of that, it looks fantastic!",
