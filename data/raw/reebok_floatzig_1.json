  "pros": "Unique retro-inspired design; All-around reflectivity; Higher stack than other daily trainers; Doubles as a sneaker; Durable TPE midsole; Wide and stable heel; Suitable for long runs; Fairly priced; Ortholite footbed",
  "cons": "Snug midfoot and tapered toebox; On the heavier side; Outsole durability; Firm feel",
  "RR_verdict": "The Reebok FloatZig 1 captures the true zeitgeist of the ’90s and mixes it with modern tech for a surprisingly solid, cushioned ride. We believe its design stands out among daily trainers, offering a well-balanced blend of comfort and stability. However, the outsole showed more wear than expected, and the snug midfoot could be an issue for some. Still, it’s a distinct choice for retro enthusiasts wanting a running shoe that also shines as a stylish sneaker—all at a reasonable price.",
