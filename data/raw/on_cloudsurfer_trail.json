  "pros": "Exceptional outsole durability; Excellent build quality; Truly versatile design; Remarkably light for trail use; Cushioned; Flexible and comfortable; Wonderful for heel strikers; Works well on asphalt or concrete",
  "cons": "High drop for trail running; Pricier than similar models",
  "RR_verdict": "We believe the Cloudsurfer Trail from On significantly elevates its road version to become an exceptional all-terrain shoe—perfect for travel and versatile enough for varied adventures. It maintains the high-quality materials and overall feel of its counterpart but enhances outsole durability with a robust Missiongrip rubber and ruggedized upper modifications. However, we found the drop somewhat high for trail use, and it's priced slightly above most comparable shoes.",
