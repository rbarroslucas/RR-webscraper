  "total_score": "90",
  "pros": "Lightweight; Enhanced with more Lightstrike Pro superfoam; Suits various running paces; Can double as a racer for beginners; Spacious fit; Highly breathable; Excellent value; Surprisingly plush upper; Grippy even in rain",
  "cons": "Tongue design needs enhancement; Outsole durability; Not very stable",
  "RR_verdict": "The Adidas Adizero SL2 presents a distinctive approach as a daily trainer, diverging notably from current market trends. We really liked its emphasis on providing a dynamic, lightweight, and enjoyable ride, though it does sacrifice stability in the process. In our testing, we also noted that the outsole could benefit from some enhancements. Despite these areas for improvement, we found it to be a refreshing, well-priced option and a worthy sequel to the original SL, leaving us quite satisfied!",
