  "total_score": "84",
  "pros": "Versatile for various activities; Reduced weight from v1; Comfortable fit; Breathable, plush upper; Secure lockdown with gusseted tongue; Well-cushioned; Fairly priced; Super stable",
  "cons": "Limited energy return; Traction in wet could be better; Bulky heel; Narrow toebox",
  "RR_verdict": "We think the Hoka Kawana 2 is a strong sequel to Hoka's versatile shoe, ideal for walking, running, and gym workouts. It offers ample cushioning with a plush, durable upper, though we still found it a bit heavy. Despite the same EVA midsole lacking energy return, we think it's enough for casual runners. For us, this update is a great choice for those seeking a do-it-all shoe at a fair price.",
