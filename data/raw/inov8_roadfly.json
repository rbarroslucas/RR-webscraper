  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Foot-shaped, anatomic toebox; Full-length outsole coverage; Ultra-cushy insole; Excellent ground feel; Playful and agile ride; Good traction; Doubles as a casual shoe; Reasonably priced",
  "cons": "Not the best for forefoot strikers; Drop varies too much from stated specs; Needs a lighter build; Low energy return",
  "RR_verdict": "The Inov8 Roadfly blends influences from various brands and running shoe trends. Its anatomic toebox offers exceptional comfort and generous room for toe splay, while the grippy outsole and agile ride make it versatile across multiple terrains. However, we were let down by its high weight relative to the stack height, which we believe needs improvement. Despite this, it’s an interesting, fairly-priced choice for runners seeking a firm and natural ride without fully committing to zero-drop geometry.",
