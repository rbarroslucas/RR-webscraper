  "brand": "Brooks",
  "total_score": "82",
  "pros": "Fantastic stability; Impressively cushioned; All-day comfort; World-class outsole durability; Superb lockdown with zero slippage; Extra-breathable mesh; Multiple width options; New DNA Tuned midsole; Does the job as a casual shoe",
  "cons": "Underfoot feel is firm; Slightly heavy; EVA-based foam lacks energy return; Small price bump",
  "RR_verdict": "The Glycerin GTS 22 doesn’t try to reinvent anything—and that’s part of its charm. We found in the lab that it delivers a support-loaded ride with top comfort for long runs and world-class outsole durability. Brooks introduced the DNA Tuned midsole as its major improvement, which felt a bit firmer than expected on our runs, but for those who enjoy a stable underfoot experience, it does the job. In our view, it's a good upgrade and a worthy 22nd chapter in the series!",
