  "total_score": "74",
  "pros": "Works well as a road-to-trail shoe; Easy on the wallet; Great for trail novices; Good impact protection; Well-padded and cushy upper; Solid traction on and off-road; Breathable and protective toebox; Strong arch-support",
  "cons": "Not for technical trails; No rock plate; Midsole feels rather dull",
  "RR_verdict": "The New Balance 510 v6 is a versatile runner that takes us seamlessly from road to trail. Offroading novices will do well with the shoe's subtle yet grippy lugs that feel quite natural underfoot almost immediately. What's more, it has a well-cushioned and smooth ride that is neither too soft nor bouncy; making it great for when we traverse uneven surfaces. The generous padding and arch support also mean that we were never in a rush to take the shoe off at the end of a testing session. While it may not be very well-suited for rocky or technical trails, we can't really ask more from a shoe that already does so much at the 510 v6's sub-$100 price tag.",
