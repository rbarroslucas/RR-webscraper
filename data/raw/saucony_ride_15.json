  "RR_verdict": "With comfort and lightness on our feet, the fifteenth version of the Saucony Ride nails it to a T! We actually think that it might be the best Saucony Ride iteration to date! As a workhorse, we love that it's ready to make our short to long runs insanely comfy and easy with its plush cushion and smooth ride. Even more, it's got protection written all over it, so don't worry about achy feet and legs after racking up miles on the pavement.",
