  "pros": "Comfy all-day; Great value; Wide toebox; Good for walking & gym; Perfect for beginners and heel strikers; Lightweight; Durable outsole; Well-cushioned sockliner",
  "cons": "Firm midsole; Limited vertical room in the toebox; Low forefoot cushioning",
  "RR_verdict": "The Under Armour Charged Pursuit 3 is an affordable option designed for casual runners or those prioritizing value over advanced features. During our runs, we found its firm midsole paired with a thick outsole to be an excellent choice for budget-conscious buyers. While it may not satisfy serious runners seeking plush cushioning or innovative tech, we believe its wide toebox and simple design are ideal for beginners looking for a versatile, cost-effective shoe for walking, gym sessions, and short runs.",
