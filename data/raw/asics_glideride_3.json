  "RR_verdict": "Considered the go-long running shoe from ASICS, the GlideRide 3 impressed us with a softer and lighter ride than before. Given its dedication to stability (even though it's a neutral shoe) and comfort, we think that it runs best on easy days. Overall, the ASICS GlideRide 3 screams luxurious comfort that can eat up miles on the road.",
