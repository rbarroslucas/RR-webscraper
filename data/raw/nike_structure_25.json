  "RR_verdict": "With its distinct lack of medial posts or a rigid shank and ridiculously cushy midsole, we're hard-pressed to describe the Nike Structure 25 as a stability shoe. However, the way its smooth and supportive ride that subtly nudges us toward a more neutral stride is undeniable. This workhorse of a daily trainer may not be the fastest, but we found that it's comfortable and responsive enough for easier paces whether we were out for a recovery run or steadily crushing mile markers on longer hauls. Also, the shoe's warm upper and consistent performance in our freezer tests means that it's not just a fair-weather friend but an excellent year-round companion.",
