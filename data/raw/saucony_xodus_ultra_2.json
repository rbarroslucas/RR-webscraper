  "brand": "Saucony",
  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Snug, secure fit; Highly breathable; Enhanced lacing from v1; Responsive midsole; Upgraded durability; Solid, stable feel; Long-run-ready cushioning",
  "cons": "Bootie upper might feel odd to some; Slightly heavy for its size; Firm cushioning",
  "RR_verdict": "The Xodus Ultra 2 caught our attention in the lab as a versatile trail runner, perfect for those seeking a reliable all-rounder. On our runs, we were impressed by its responsive PWRRUN PB midsole and the robust grip of the PWRTRAC outsole, which, combined with a breathable upper, makes it a jack-of-all-trails. It's ready for anything, even the occasional hike, thanks to its flexibility. While we think Saucony could lighten the weight and soften the foam for future versions, we see this as a solid step up from its predecessor, signaling a bright path ahead for the Xodus series.",
