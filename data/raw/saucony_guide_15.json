  "cons": "Lacks bounce; Too much rubber outsole in the heel",
  "RR_verdict": "The Guide 15 from Saucony is a lightweight stability shoe that we believe is perfect for easy training runs on the road. With the support it provides, it delivers a surefooted ride for testers among us with flat feet and overpronation. Even more, it lets go of the stability conventions of the past being light and non-taxing on the foot. It's firm, but just enough to keep our feet steady and supported.",
