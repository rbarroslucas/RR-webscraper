  "pros": "Supreme stability... in a supershoe!; World-class energy return and cushioning; Feather-light and agile; A dream come true for marathoners; Wonderful breathability; Top-notch grip, even in wet conditions; Outstanding outsole durability; Accommodates wide feet",
  "cons": "Risk of heel slippage; Lacing can be tricky; Not suited for heel strikers",
  "RR_verdict": "The Adizero Adios Pro 3 stands out as one of the top racing shoes available in the market, if not the absolute best. Its phenomenal stability sets a new standard for supershoes, and we found the full-length Energyrods synergize perfectly with the bouncy Lightstrike Pro foam during our fast-paced runs. With its wider design, it accommodates wide feet and grips even in wet conditions. While it's hard to pinpoint any major drawbacks, we believe the upper could be fine-tuned for v4 in terms of comfort.",
