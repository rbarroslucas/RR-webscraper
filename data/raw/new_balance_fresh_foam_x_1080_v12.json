  "pros": "Protective cushion; Lively ride; Smooth transitions; Stable when cornering; Comfy upper; Durable outsole; Welcomes wide feet; For heavy runners; Grippy on snow, slush, and slick surfaces; No lace bites; Great heel hold; An eye-catcher",
  "cons": "Not for narrow feet; Bottom-heavy for fast runs; Questionable breathability",
  "RR_verdict": "If you're looking for a great middle between the more traditional, lower-stacked NB 880 v11 and the uber-cushy NB Fresh Foam More v3, we firmly recommend the Fresh Foam X 1080 v12. It's a comfortable cruiser that's perfect for anything easy to moderate. And with the copious amount of foam it possesses, we got to experience a gem in long-distance runs where protection and stability are at the forefront.",
