  "pros": "Ideal for hot climates; Perfect for everyday life; Exceptional comfort; Fantastic value; Great for beginners and heel strikers; Flyknit upper under $100!; Really lightweight; Upper durability",
  "cons": "Not enough energy return; Outsole lacks grip; Only for short and easy runs",
  "RR_verdict": "The Nike Interact Run marks a milestone as the first sub-$100 Nike with a Flyknit upper, a feature once exclusive to premium models. We really liked how it combines lightness and comfort, making it an appealing option for casual runners who need versatility for both daily life and light running. However, in our lab tests, we found the outsole lacking in durability and the midsole subpar in terms of cushioning, which might disappoint some. Additionally, the design may be polarizing, as it looks as though two different shoes were fused together, each comprising half of the final product.",
