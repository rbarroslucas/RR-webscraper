  "RR_verdict": "On our tests, we witnessed how comfortable, well-cushioned, protective, and ideal for daily runs of any distance the Nike React Miler 3 is. It might not stand out as one of the best road shoes out there, but it offers a smooth, predictable ride and gets the job done. On top of this, it's reasonably priced and we see it as a good choice for beginners who prefer slow-paced runs.",
