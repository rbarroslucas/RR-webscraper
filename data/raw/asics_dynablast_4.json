  "RR_verdict": "The Dynablast 4 is a neutral road shoe offering from ASICS that sets a high standard for versatile daily trainers on a budget. The FF Blast midsole foam doesn't just feel comfy during our test runs but has a nice energetic pop that allows us to pick up the pace or gobble up miles at will. What's more, it's flexible and forgiving right out of the box, making for a pleasant ride that leaves us feeling fresh even after higher-intensity sessions. While we did find its breathability to be lacking in our smoke test, making it a little too toasty for summer runs, the shoe's performance in our freezer tests makes it a great option for cold-weather runners.",
