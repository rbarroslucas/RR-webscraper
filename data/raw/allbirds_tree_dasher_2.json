  "total_score": "87",
  "pros": "Comfortable and breathable upper; Constructed with sustainable materials; Carbon neutral; Significant enhancements over v1; Provides a stable ride; Suitable for walking and gym training; Excellent lockdown; Spacious enough for really wide feet",
  "cons": "Might be excessively firm; Overly spacious for those with narrow feet; Pricey considering its performance",
  "RR_verdict": "The Allbirds Tree Dasher 2.0 seamlessly blends lifestyle appeal with sports functionality, emerging as a standout carbon-neutral choice. In our lab testing, we found it to be the perfect daily trainer for those who value sustainability without compromising on comfort. Its breathable knit upper and stable ride really impressed us, exceeding our expectations. On top of that, this shoe excels as both a walking and gym training partner, truly embodying the spirit of an eco-friendly, do-it-all workhorse. However, we found the midsole might be too firm for some, and it falls short for those seeking high energy return and performance, particularly on long runs.",
