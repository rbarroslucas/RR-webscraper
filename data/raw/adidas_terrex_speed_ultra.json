  "RR_verdict": "I discovered that most trail runners haven't been very keen on Adidas trail shoes. They seemed like an afterthought given that the brand's focus was admittedly on sneakers and soccer cleats. But then the Adidas Terrex Speed Ultra arrived. It performed so well out on the trails that even I have chosen it as my go-to.",
