  "RR_verdict": "The On Cloudspark is uniquely crafted with women in mind from the start, though it’s also a solid choice for men. In our tests, we really liked its premium-quality, roomy upper and the stability it provides during runs. However, we found the shoe to be quite firm underfoot, which might not be everyone's preference. Additionally, considering its high price, we were concerned about its durability.",
