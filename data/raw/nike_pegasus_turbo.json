  "pros": "Excellent grip; Smooth ride; Great lockdown; Stable; Padded and supportive heel; Durable outsole; Aesthetically beautiful; 50% recycled materials",
  "cons": "Lacks responsiveness; Stiff and warm upper; Laces are just too long; Not the fast and nimble shoe that we expected",
  "RR_verdict": "The Nike Pegasus Turbo Next Nature was highly-expected as the successor of the beloved Nike Zoom Pegasus Turbo 2. Eventually, it proved to be something quite different, yet we still found it to be a solid lightweight daily trainer that gives its best when the pace is pushed up. And given that it’s made with recycled materials from post-manufactured waste, it is a great effort to offer an environmentally-friendly shoe.",
