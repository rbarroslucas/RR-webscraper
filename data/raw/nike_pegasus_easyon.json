  "pros": "Fast-entry EasyOn system; Convenient one-hand elastic laces; Improved ReactX midsole; Exceptional breathability; Air Zoom units for more bounce; Triathlon-friendly; No price increase from Pegasus 41; Amazing as a lifestyle shoe",
  "cons": "Stability reduced by EasyOn design; Low toebox durability",
  "RR_verdict": "The Nike Pegasus EasyOn is a unique twist on the best-selling Pegasus 41, keeping the trusted ReactX midsole and waffle outsole but introducing the EasyOn technology. In our lab tests, we discovered that the elastic laces and collapsible heel made slipping into the shoe remarkably simple. While the revamped upper and heel slightly impact stability and toebox durability, we found the EasyOn feature adds outstanding convenience and accessibility without increasing the price.",
