  "RR_verdict": "We are impressed with the 6th version of the Altra Torin because it is a road running shoe that's ready to chomp the miles up ahead. It revealed itself to us as a very cushioned and comfortable shoe that feels like home for the foot. But what's more is that the Torin 6 also kept our strides alive and kicking.",
