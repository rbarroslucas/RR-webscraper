  "pros": "Glove-like fit; Perfect lockdown; Has an elf tab; Lightweight; Balanced; Superb comfort; Extremely stable; Large reflective elements",
  "cons": "Stiff for an everyday trainer; Not a tempo shoe either; Break-in period needed",
  "RR_verdict": "The Hoka Mach 4 is what I consider a do-it-all daily running shoe that shines on medium to medium/fast days. It's touted as a fast shoe, but it doesn't prove to be very speed-inspiring. It's light and nimble, but not mushy, making it a shoe that's comfortable enough for my daily runs and capable when the pace is pushed. What's surprising is that I found that this Hoka doesn't skimp on padding, but it is nevertheless an ultralight shoe!",
