  "RR_verdict": "The Rincon 4 from Hoka marks a notable improvement over its predecessor, significantly enhancing both energy return and stability without sacrificing the affordability and lightness that defined earlier models. In our lab testing, however, we noted that durability is a significant issue with this version. Additionally, the increased stack height, while improving comfort, contributes to a slight but noticeable weight gain.",
