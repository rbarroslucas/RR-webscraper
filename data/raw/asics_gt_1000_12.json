  "RR_verdict": "The ASICS GT 1000 12 maintains its reputation as a versatile stability running shoe. With fantastic comfort and impressive breathability, this shoe transitioned seamlessly into cross-training or walks around the block during our tests. And it's a gem for those looking to score a stability shoe without breaking the bank. Yet, while it covers most bases beautifully, we think speed enthusiasts might find the Flytefoam midsole lacks energy return.",
