  "cons": "Not as fast as other tempo trainers; Lackluster breathability; Laces too short for the runner's knot",
  "RR_verdict": "The Launch GTS 9 is the stability version of the versatile and speedy daily trainer from Brooks. However, unlike most shoes aimed at overpronators, it's a lightweight and nimble shoe that unobtrusively corrects our foot alignment in a way that even neutral runners will appreciate. We really enjoyed the balance struck between support and comfort which makes the shoe a great choice for beginners and experienced runners alike. While it may not be the fastest horse out of the gate, we had no issues pushing the pace or even going the distance thanks to the lively BioMoGo midsole foam that brought a pleasant bounce to our strides. What's more, we found that it's an incredibly well-built shoe that's built to last, making its $110 price tag seem even more of a steal.",
