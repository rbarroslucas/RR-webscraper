  "cons": "Short runs only; Lack of proper outsole; Insole not removable",
  "RR_verdict": "Ah, the Nike Free Run… For me, calling this a running shoe is a stretch, but it came to my attention that there’s still a vestige of folks out there in the minimalist fan group that likes the slipper-like feel of Nike’s long-running “Free” lineup. What I like about the Nike Free Run 5.0 is it steers back toward a less bizarre-looking shoe than we saw in 2020 but continues with the ultralight and ultra-flexible design.",
