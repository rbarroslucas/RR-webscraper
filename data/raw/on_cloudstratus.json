  "RR_verdict": "On Cloudstratus nails the role of a firm-yet-comfy road running shoe, perfect for casual runners who enjoy moderate paces. In our tests, we found it's even versatile enough to double for cross-training or walking. While it leans a bit towards the expensive side at $170 and durability might raise an eyebrow, we consider its well-rounded features and amazing build quality make it a popular choice for those seeking an all-purpose running shoe.",
