  "brand": "Salomon",
  "total_score": "74",
  "pros": "Tank-like foot protection; Incredibly stable and supportive ride; Excellent traction on mixed or rocky trails; Great hiking/backpacking companion; Relatively flexible despite 3D chassis; Effectively dampens landings; Generously padded and comfortable; No chance of lace bite; Durable and high-quality construction; Eye-catching design",
  "cons": "A little heavy; Stiff upper needs breaking in; Cushioning on the firm side; Not nimble enough for technical trails",
  "RR_verdict": "Whether we're out for an easy run in nature or a long sauntering hike, the Salomon XA Pro 3D v9 is a trail runner that tackles all our outdoor needs in comfort and style. We found that it truly shines in stability and support thanks to the 3D chassis which gives us confidence with every stride. While it may be a little on the heavy side, it's a small price to pay for all the protective overlays that had us trudging along like tanks while the generous internal padding pampered our feet. Moreover, at only $140, it's a great bang for our buck.",
