  "brand": "Adidas",
  "total_score": "85",
  "pros": "Cushioned for long miles; Supportive for a neutral shoe; Wide platform; Secure foothold; Well-padded interiors; Highly breathable; Great for casual wear; Value for money; True to size",
  "cons": "Heavier than average; Firm heel landings",
  "RR_verdict": "The Adidas Adistar 2.0 is a neutral daily trainer on steroids. We could easily mistake it for a stability shoe if we wore it with our eyes closed. It's got a well-cushioned, wide, and supportive platform which, in our opinion, works best for those easy recovery days. If we look past its disturbingly heavy setup, we can claim the Adistar 2.0 as a solid daily running option.",
