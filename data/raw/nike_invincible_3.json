  "total_score": "81",
  "pros": "Way more stable than previous versions; Tall stack of impact-absorbing cushioning; Good energy return; Comfort for the entire foot; Thicker, more durable outsole; A solid ride that works for more runners; Breathable; Great for recovery days and long easy runs",
  "cons": "Heel slippage; Heel clip can be irritating when cornering",
  "RR_verdict": "The Invincible Run is a shoe that barely needs an introduction. It’s among the most (if not the most) comfortable max-cushioned trainers that we put on our feet, alongside the More and the Bondi. In this third iteration, the shoe moved away from the unadulterated wildness of the v2 in favor of practicality and versatility. The outcome? We experienced a ride that was less soft and bouncy but more stable and controlled. It’s the Invincible for runners who couldn’t handle the Invincible.",
