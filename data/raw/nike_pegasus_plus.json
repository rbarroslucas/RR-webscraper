  "pros": "Amazing look; Bouncy ZoomX midsole; Much faster than a regular Pegasus; Great for tempo sessions; Flexible build; Good option for lightweight runners; Versatile for multiple paces; Classic, fun running experience",
  "cons": "Limited stability; Narrow, tapered toebox; Overpriced; Non-gusseted tongue",
  "RR_verdict": "The Pegasus Turbo 4, rebranded at the last minute as the Pegasus Plus, still carries its legacy as a lightweight, responsive, and versatile runner—but it's no longer the magical, one-of-a-kind shoe it was back in 2018. In our experience, it offers a lightweight, responsive feel, but we found it slightly overpriced compared to the competition and notably snug in fit. That’s nothing new for this line, though, and we believe it’s the best Turbo yet—if Nike lets us call it that. We were also impressed by its sleek, race-inspired design. All in all, it’s gorgeous and fast, but not for everyone.",
