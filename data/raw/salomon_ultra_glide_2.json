  "brand": "Salomon",
  "total_score": "86",
  "pros": "Breathable upper; One heck of a lockdown; Soft and protective cushioning; Good energy return; Very smooth, fun ride; Comfy for roads, good traction on moderately technical trails; Outstanding for daily miles and (very) long runs; Also works for faster efforts",
  "cons": "Poor outsole durability; Using lace garage can get frustrating; Long tongue has a tendency to cause some rubbing; Maybe too narrow for some",
  "RR_verdict": "Don’t let anybody tell you otherwise—running fast and running comfortably aren’t supposed to be mutually exclusive in an ultra-distance race. Case in point: the Ultra Glide 2. As Salomon’s second crack at their cushioned trail line, the shoe addresses the v1’s stability issues and it's softer than before. In our tests, we found it to be a fantastic versatile runner that could keep the Speedgoat and Xodus Ultra on their toes.",
