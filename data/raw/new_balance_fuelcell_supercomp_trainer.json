  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Incredibly bouncy and soft; Extremely protective underfoot; Top-quality upper; Stable for a “super-shoe”; Versatile for different paces; Great lockdown; Ready straight out of the box; Welcomes wide feet; Massive, yet great-looking",
  "cons": "Heavy; Collects some rocks",
  "RR_verdict": "With its 40+ mm stack, the New Balance FuelCell SuperComp Trainer is one of the tallest road running shoes we have ever tested, so high that it’s not even allowed in World Athletics events. For all other situations, especially marathon training, we believe that this is a superb max-cushioned carbon-plated trainer. It is so massive, protective, and fun to ride in that we were surprised the first time we used it.",
