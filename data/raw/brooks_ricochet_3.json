  "RR_verdict": "A simple and no-fuss daily trainer, the Brooks Ricochet 3 helped me roll through my strides with ease and comfort! It isn't necessarily wow-worthy, but it's a solid middle-ground between overly soft shoes and fast-tempo shoes. In short, it's utilitarian - cushy for easy days, and responsive enough when I want to pick up the pace. Even more, it's a durable shoe that lasted me hundreds of miles!",
