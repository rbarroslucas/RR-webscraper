  "brand": "ASICS",
  "total_score": "78",
  "pros": "Stable ride; Cushioned for long runs; Good performance-to-price ratio; Ideal for beginners; Solid outsole durability; Great option for heel strikers; Can be used as a casual shoe; Inspired by Novablast DNA",
  "cons": "Not for summer; Upper durability concerns; Narrow fit; Probably a bit heavy",
  "RR_verdict": "We think the Versablast 4 is much more than a budget Novablast. In our tests, it delivered a smooth-and-steady ride with just enough bounce to make daily runs enjoyable. For our feet, the underfoot feel was really good, though we found the snug fit will not work for everyone. It performs especially well for heel strikers and newer runners, and we believe it’s one of the top budget-friendly options out there right now.",
