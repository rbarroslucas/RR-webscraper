  "total_score": "90",
  "pros": "Unique rockered geometry delivers a fun ride; Fantastic choice for midfoot strikers; Fiberglass plate balances flex and propulsion; Good fit for most feet; High-stack forefoot for cushioned landings; Reflective details enhance safety at night; Excellent for tempo runs; Can handle workouts and daily runs alike",
  "cons": "Absolutely not for heel strikers; Non-removable insole; Upper durability concerns; Enerzy foam lacks bouncy and it's too firm",
  "RR_verdict": "With its radical heel bevel and exaggerated rocker, the Mizuno Wave Rebellion Flash 2 offers a thrilling, forward-rolling sensation that caters to midfoot strikers but feels awkward for heel-first runners. In our tests, the midsole delivered a moderately energetic ride, though it lacked the responsiveness and stability of other supertrainers. That said, the G3 Rubber outsole stood out with its excellent grip, making it a strong and reasonably-priced option for those who embrace its unconventional design.",
