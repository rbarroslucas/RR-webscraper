  "pros": "Exceptionally cushioned; Impressively lightweight for its size; Extremely comfortable; Remarkably stable; Durable outsole with long-lasting performance; A genuine maximalist version of the Ghost; Reasonably priced at $150; Offered in three width options",
  "cons": "Tongue is not fixed to the sides; Lacks energy return; Not very flexible",
  "RR_verdict": "The Brooks Ghost Max is like the regular Ghost but on steroids, offering a skyscraper-high midsole combined with a stable ride, especially for heel strikers. In our tests, we were impressed with its performance on long runs and easy days. And despite its substantial size, it's still surprisingly lightweight. The upper is really comfortable and it's well-ventilated, though it does fall short in durability and lacks a gusseted tongue. However, these are minor quibbles in what we found to be an excellent, fairly-priced maximalist option from Brooks, capable of devouring miles with ease.",
