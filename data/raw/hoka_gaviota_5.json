  "brand": "HOKA",
  "total_score": "83",
  "pros": "Remarkably stable; Breathable and comfortable upper; Lightweight for its size; Plushier than ever; Good stability option for forefoot strikers; Ideal for wide feet; Excellent for long runs",
  "cons": "Low drop might pose issues for heel strikers; Performs poorly in colder conditions; Not for narrow feet",
  "RR_verdict": "The Gaviota 5 by Hoka confidently steps out as an evolved successor, not just a mere follow-up. Upholding the features that made its predecessor a hit, this iteration boasts a noticeably refined weight, a plushier midsole, and enhanced ventilation. While its pronounced low drop may challenge certain runners, in our opinion, if stability coupled with modern features is what you're after, the Gaviota 5 is really hard to overlook.",
