  "brand": "HOKA",
  "total_score": "75",
  "pros": "Crazy lightweight; Exceptionally fast; Cushioned for its low weight; Nice ankle gaiter combined with a sock-like upper; Race-ready fit; Handles technical trails and turns with top speed; Features a Vibram Megagrip Litebase outsole",
  "cons": "Upper durability may be compromised; Really narrow; The CMEVA midsole isn't reflective of its $180 pricing.",
  "RR_verdict": "For those seeking trail speed, the Hoka Zinal 2 stands as our definitive contender. Priced at $180, it might stretch some budgets, but we found that its featherlight design with a low stack height is primed for short trail races. On top of that, we discovered that the fantastic Vibram Megagrip outsole guarantees solid traction across varied terrains. However, it's only tailored for those with medium or narrow feet.",
