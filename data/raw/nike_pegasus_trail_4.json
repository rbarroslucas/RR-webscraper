  "RR_verdict": "The React Pegasus Trail 4 is one of the top road-to-trail options from Nike that we have ever worn and scrutinized. Cushiony and responsive on the roads yet grippy and stable on the trails, the shoe makes a perfect hybrid. It also remains surprisingly light given all the features packed into it. We are happy that it feels a lot like the original Pegasus Trail 36 but with an enhanced grip.",
