  "cons": "Heavy; Not breathable; Poor draining",
  "RR_verdict": "Aggressive!!! That’s the first impression that I had about the Endorphin Trail. With the shoe's meaty, deep lugs, and thick, dense midsole, it flies down any terrain I can throw at it. It’s a bit of a tank, but its PB midsole is springy, and its rockered design lets me efficiently coast gentler terrain between the hard stuff. Lace these up and head into your next trail battle with confidence!",
