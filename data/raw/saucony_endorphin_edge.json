  "RR_verdict": "The Endorphin Edge from Saucony is the brand's bounce-back from the not-so-great Saucony Endorphin Trail. And this time around, we see a premium shoe that has a carbon-fiber plate, is max-cushioned, and can go fast, fast, fast. Even better, we discovered that it's now ready for runs ranging from short to long distances.",
