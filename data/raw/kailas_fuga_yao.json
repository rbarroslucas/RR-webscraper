  "pros": "Highly cushioned; Unbelievably lightweight; Propulsive carbon plate; Rocker shape rolls you forward; Stable platform; Versatile (road-to-trail); Breathable upper; Secure lockdown; Quick and easy lacing; Affordable for its kind",
  "cons": "Not for wide feet; Shallow lugs",
  "RR_verdict": "A max-cushioned trail shoe with a nearly 40 mm heel stack? With a carbon plate? For $160? We loved all of these in the Kailas Fuga YAO, which we also think is a hidden gem in the sea of trail running shoes. It is very easy to overlook due to the brand's relatively recent appearance on the market. And yet, since you're already here, a long list of the shoe's benefits might end your search for a new high-performance pair right now.",
