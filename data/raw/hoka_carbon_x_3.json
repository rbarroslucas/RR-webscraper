  "RR_verdict": "True to its roots, the Carbon X 3 remains our trusty go-to for anything ultra-distance. It's packed and loaded with a carbon-fiber plate that makes it a highly stable and snappy ride. Even more, it delivers smooth heel-to-toe transitions that have made our long-distance runs bearable and easy. On top of this, it's everything you'd expect from a luxe running shoe. From looks to performance, it kills it!",
