  "RR_verdict": "The Brooks Adrenaline GTS 23 builds on the winning recipe that made its predecessors favored among runners all around the world. We found that it shines as a reliable, well-cushioned, and stable daily trainer that's perfect for easy to moderate runs. Even with a slight shortfall in forefoot cushioning, we think that its value at $140 marks it as a standout choice and a welcome enhancement over prior models.",
