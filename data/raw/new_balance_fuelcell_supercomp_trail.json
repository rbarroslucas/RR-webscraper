  "total_score": "90",
  "pros": "Extremely lightweight; Plush FuelCell foam; High-performance Vibram Megagrip outsole; Breathable upper; Ideal for heel strikers; Priced below trail supershoes; Secure fit; Good durability",
  "cons": "Lacks energy return; Narrow toebox limits toe splay; Not very stable; Steep drop punishes forefoot strikers",
  "RR_verdict": "New Balance’s first trail supershoe attempt shows promise but fades before crossing the finish line. We found that it delivers an ultra-soft, lightweight ride with a top-class Vibram outsole. However, the previous-gen, non-PEBA FuelCell foam left some energy return on the table. In our lab tests, the midsole felt plush but not as responsive as other high-performance trail shoes. Fortunately, the price reflects this, making it more accessible than most competitors. For us, it delivers speed and fun on trails, but still lacks true supershoe status.",
