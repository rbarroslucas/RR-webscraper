  "total_score": "90",
  "pros": "Exceptionally extreme in every aspect; Incredibly enjoyable and fun ride; Ideal for midfoot strikers; Abundant race-day legal cushioning; Outsole provides excellent grip, even in wet conditions; Less stiff compared to other racing shoes; Cozy and decently wide upper",
  "cons": "Might feel really weird at first; Definitely not suitable for heel strikers; Subpar durability",
  "RR_verdict": "The Mizuno Wave Rebellion Pro stands alone with its unique, aggressive geometry, perfect for midfoot strikers but unsuitable for the rest. The crazy stack height and wild midsole cutouts render it an excellent marathon racer, but it's not a good shoe for those with stability issues. If it aligns with your running style and your upcoming race isn't filled with tight corners, we found this one-of-a-kind shoe takes the crown for the most cushioned option in the market.",
