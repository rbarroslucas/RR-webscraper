  "brand": "Nike",
  "total_score": "91",
  "pros": "Insanely lightweight; Very breathable; Bouncy; Responsive; FAST; No break-in period needed; Good grip on dry surfaces",
  "cons": "Not ideal for wide feet; Unstable; Forefoot strikers only",
  "RR_verdict": "The Nike ZoomX Vaporfly NEXT% 2 is probably one of the fastest shoes on the market, but I discovered some problems: It’s unstable, a bit too narrow still, looks ridiculous, and hits the pocketbook hard. If your job is to run fast, or you’re a sponsored athlete, I think these shoes may be the tool to help you win, but for the average Joe who wants to drop two minutes off their 5K time, it may be too much tech in a shoe that's a better fit for the 1% club.",
