  "brand": "Nike",
  "total_score": "86",
  "pros": "13% lighter than the Vaporfly 3; Awesome for 5K, 10K and 21K races; Full ZoomX midsole; Spring-loaded carbon-fiber Flyplate; Fantastic lockdown with premium laces; Moderate rocker for a more natural ride; Improved perforated, removable insole; Better rubber coverage in the forefoot; Gets improvements from the Alphafly 3; Great upper featuring breathability and durability",
  "cons": "Less ideal for marathon racing; Still lacks the snappy feel of the Vaporfly 1&2; Narrow midfoot and heel limit stability",
  "RR_verdict": "We believe the Vaporfly 4 is a smart update, but not the groundbreaking reinvention some runners might have expected from Nike. After testing it in the lab and pounding the roads, we loved its feather-light construction, the much-improved fit that fixes the annoying tongue from the v3, and the upgrades in the upper and outsole. However, runners hoping for a major boost in performance will likely be disappointed—it’s simply a smoother, more refined Vaporfly that borrows a few ideas from the Alphafly but won’t magically slash your race times, feeling now more natural and better suited for shorter distances.",
