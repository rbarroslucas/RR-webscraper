  "RR_verdict": "As observed in our wear tests, the Lite 3 from Reebok is a daily trainer whose chief focus is comfort. We really enjoyed its plush and lively ride that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. At $65, it's a budget running shoe that we feel is perfect for runners who want a bang for their buck. And if it's a supportive neutral shoe you're after, the Reebok Lite 3 won't be anticlimactic.",
