  "brand": "New Balance",
  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Great fit with gusseted tongue; Roomy for wider feet; Fairly priced; Soft, comfortable knit; Lighter than its predecessor; Plush midsole; Generous outsole coverage; Available in up to four widths",
  "cons": "Lacks energy return; Limited airflow; Midsole gets firm in winter",
  "RR_verdict": "We believe the New Balance Fresh Foam X 880 v14 is a strong contender for runners seeking a dependable daily trainer. We found the knit upper to be incredibly comfortable, offering a roomy fit for longer runs. We also discovered that it's lighter than previous versions, enhancing its overall versatility. However, the midsole still lacks energy return, and the upper runs hot in summer conditions. Despite these downsides, this is definitely the best 880 yet!",
