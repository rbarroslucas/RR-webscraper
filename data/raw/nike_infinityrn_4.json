  "brand": "Nike",
  "total_score": "85",
  "pros": "All-new ReactX plush midsole; Soft and stretchy Flyknit upper; Ideal for heel strikers; Generously cushioned; Excellent for easy runs; Feels like running on clouds; Durable, long-lasting outsole; Reduced carbon footprint",
  "cons": "Average-at-best breathability; On the heavier side; Sizes run notably small",
  "RR_verdict": "The Nike InfinityRN 4 distinctively differentiates itself from its previous model. Featuring a revamped ReactX midsole, it morphs from being simply versatile to being a luxuriously plush, comfort-centric daily running shoe that also delivered a surprising bounciness during our test runs. Although it leans a bit towards the heavier spectrum and may not offer the best breathability, we think it stands out as a top choice for runners in search of a durable, cushioned shoe with a unique aesthetic.",
