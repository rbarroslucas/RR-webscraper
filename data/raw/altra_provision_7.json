  "total_score": "83",
  "pros": "Snug and secure lockdown; Foot-shaped toe box for natural toe splay; Stable without being intrusive; Excellent traction across various surfaces; Highly breathable design; Ideal for a wide range of paces; Performs well on light trails; Good durability",
  "cons": "Midsole might feel overly firm for certain runners; Unexpectedly narrow upper; Limited energy return",
  "RR_verdict": "The Altra Provision 7 steps up the game with a lighter, more stable build than its predecessors. We think it's a perfect fit for those who love low-drop, mid-stability trainers, though you should be comfortable with its slightly firmer midsole feel. Additionally, in our lab tests, we noticed the heel-to-toe drop differed slightly from the advertised 0 mm. Nevertheless, we feel its fair price and impressive features make it a standout choice for runners who want a low-drop shoe with a bit of support for their daily runs.",
