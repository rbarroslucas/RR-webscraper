  "pros": "Combines durability with breathability; Exceptionally long-lasting outsole; Versatile design for casual wear or cross-training; Enhanced plush midsole; Air cushioning improves the running experience; Easy on the wallet; Fantastic for beginners",
  "cons": "May not suit forefoot strikers; Could benefit from increased energy return",
  "RR_verdict": "The Nike Winflo 10 shines as an affordable neutral daily trainer with exceptional value. Equipped with full-length Air cushioning, a robust outsole, and a comfy yet durable upper, we think that it's an ideal choice for beginners or anyone looking for a running shoe versatile enough to also serve as a sneaker or gym shoe. However, you get what you pay for, and advanced runners might feel the midsole lacks sufficient energy return.",
