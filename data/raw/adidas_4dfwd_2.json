  "RR_verdict": "Bridging the gap between running shoes and sneakers, the Adidas 4DFWD 2 boosts an exceptional, innovative 3D-printed midsole. We found that this new version has an updated upper, a better fit, and traction, making it more convincing for running, yet still grabbing all the eyes when worn casually. What astounded us, even more, is its build that's composed of 50% recycled materials and is exceptionally long-lasting.",
