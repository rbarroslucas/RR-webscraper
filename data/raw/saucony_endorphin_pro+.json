  "RR_verdict": "A mid-season update to the Endorphin line?! Yes, please!! I felt on cloud nine because this is essentially the Endorphin Pro 2 with a lighter, more breathable upper, and an impressive half-ounce is cut off the weight (7.1 ounces vs the Pro 2 at 7.6). If you want a fast, light shoe that can finally really compete with Nike and ASICS, it’s here. Its track-like upper and rockered, stiff, propulsive ride sure does help me crush old PRs.",
