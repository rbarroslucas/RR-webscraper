  "brand": "New Balance",
  "total_score": "89",
  "pros": "Exceptional comfort; Outstanding breathability; Incredibly soft ride; Long-lasting outsole; Lightweight for its size; High-quality materials throughout the shoe; Ideal for medium or long runs at a relaxed pace; Suitable for a wide range of foot shapes",
  "cons": "The EVA-based midsole falls short in energy return; Lacks stability; Not suitable for quick-paced running",
  "RR_verdict": "In our lab tests, the New Balance Fresh Foam X 1080 v13 emerged as the top contender for those who prioritize supreme softness in a daily trainer. It's not only the most cushioned 1080 yet, but also one of the plushiest running shoes we've ever experienced. The top-notch upper and impressive durability also set a high bar that rivals will struggle to reach. However, we found the Fresh Foam X midsole falls short in energy return, a letdown for those seeking more bounce. Yet, at $165, we believe it's reasonably priced given its blend of distinctive attributes and performance.",
