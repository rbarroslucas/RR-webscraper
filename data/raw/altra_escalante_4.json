  "total_score": "86",
  "pros": "Minimalist, flexible ride; Outstanding outsole; Spacious extra-wide toebox; Superb stability; Lightweight; Highly durable upper; Recaptures Escalante 1.5 vibes",
  "cons": "Poor ventilation; Midsole lacks energy return; Non-gusseted tongue",
  "RR_verdict": "The Escalante 4 marks a long-awaited return to the series' origins. In our testing, we discovered that Altra has masterfully balanced a spacious zero-drop shoe with a close-to-the-ground running experience. The revamped knit upper is incredibly cozy, though it could benefit from improved ventilation, and the tongue remains non-gusseted. Despite these minor issues, we think it’s a great upgrade, solidifying its status as an ideal choice for minimalist enthusiasts seeking a versatile shoe suitable for running, walking, or cross-training in the gym.",
