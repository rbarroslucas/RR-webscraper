  "brand": "Nike",
  "total_score": "86",
  "pros": "Versatile road-to-trail performance; Grippier than the standard version; Surprisingly light for a GTX shoe; Accommodates wide feet with ease; Delivers a really stable ride for neutral runners; Upper showcases remarkable durability; Fantastic option for heel strikers",
  "cons": "Non-gusseted tongue allows water and debris to enter the shoe; Not suitable for technical terrain; Excessive drop for midfoot or forefoot strikers",
  "RR_verdict": "The Nike Pegasus Trail 4 GTX isn't just a waterproof twist on the regular Pegasus Trail. By incorporating a revamped outsole and a highly protective new upper, it has morphed into a superior shoe overall at the cost of an extra $20. We were really impressed by its surprisingly light weight despite the Gore-Tex membrane. Plus, the bouncy and comfortable React midsole is ideal for short and medium distances, making it an all-around superb performer in our tests. However, we think it does come with a few caveats, like a significant 12.8-mm heel-to-toe drop and the absence of a gusseted tongue.",
