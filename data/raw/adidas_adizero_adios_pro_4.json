  "total_score": "92",
  "pros": "Softer, bouncier Lightstrike Pro foam; Maintains the same price; No more heel slippage; Versatile from 5K to marathon distances; Durable outsole with outstanding grip; Fantastic for midfoot and forefoot strikers; Improved for faster runners; Comfortable, gusseted tongue; Lighter than Adios Pro 3",
  "cons": "Unstable for every heel striker; Narrow, tapered toebox; Upper lacks breathability; Midsole loses bounce quicker than AP3",
  "RR_verdict": "Adidas took what felt like an eternity to release the Adios Pro 4, but in our experience, the wait was absolutely worth it. The AP4 offers enhanced energy return, a lighter construction, and plush foam that feels incredible underfoot. However, it now features a narrower toebox that reduces comfort for wider feet, and we also believe heel strikers will find the lack of rear stability too uncomfortable. And while it may resemble its predecessor, we found it to be a completely different beast—designed for speed but less forgiving for casual racers.",
