  "RR_verdict": "The Pulsar Trail from Salomon represents an exceptional approach to an affordable, do-it-all trail running shoe. In our tests, we found it great at handling a variety of paces and distances, offering a remarkably stable ride. It also provides excellent foot lockdown with its QuickLace system and a cleverly integrated Energy Blade plate in its midsole. Although the outsole's grip on wet terrain isn't its strongest suit, we believe the shoe's overall performance is impressive for its reasonable price.",
