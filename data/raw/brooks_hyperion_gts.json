  "total_score": "91",
  "pros": "Extremely lightweight; Swift and race ready ride; Responsive midsole; Protective cushioning; Subtle but effective stability features; Traditional low stack geometry; Feels flexible and agile; Performance fit with an accommodating toebox; Grippy and durable outsole",
  "cons": "Lackluster rearfoot lockdown; Higher than advertised drop; Not for severely over pronating strides",
  "RR_verdict": "We found that the Brooks Hyperion GTS is a low stacked road shoe with a subtle stability system that sets the standard for what a speedy and steady tempo trainer should feel like. The Go To Support rails found at either side of the shoe’s plush yet responsive midsole form a lightweight solution that provides excellent support for those with mildly pronating strides. In our experience, if one can forgive a somewhat dodgy rearfoot lockdown, there really isn’t much negative to say about the Hyperion GTS.",
