  "RR_verdict": "Fast, nimble, and lightweight. Is this really a Hoka? Zinal is a new model from the normally plus-sized shoe manufacturer perfect for speed and doing more with less. It felt extremely breathable, comfortable, and capable. Don’t be fooled by its smaller lugs, as this shoe rolls quickly through my stride and grips amazingly well.",
