  "brand": "On",
  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Immensely breathable; Secure lockdown from heel to toe; Responsive and protective cushioning; No break-in necessary; Smooth forward-flowing ride; Doesn’t collect debris as much as v1 and v2; One fine-looking runner; Solid sustainability elements; Best for daily training and easy runs; Also great for gym workouts",
  "cons": "Slightly firm underfoot; Not advisable for long runs; Poor grip on wet surface",
  "RR_verdict": "The Cloudswift 3 is a masterclass in balancing heritage and innovation—it features all the bells and whistles of a next-gen shoe, yet still stays true to its On roots. Though upgrades to the cushioning system and upper construction immensely improved its performance, in our opinion, the foam still feels too firm underfoot. All in all, they're a solid pair of daily trainers for both longtime fans and modern runners alike.",
