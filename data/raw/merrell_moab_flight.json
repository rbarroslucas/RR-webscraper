  "pros": "Budget-friendly price; Comfortable and plush upper; Generous heel cushioning; Durable Vibram EcoStep outsole; Lightweight for a trail shoe; Flexible build enhances hiking; Secure lockdown; Reflective details; Semi-gusseted tongue",
  "cons": "Poor airflow; Not the most grippy Vibram rubber; Heel-to-toe drop feels excessive; Midsole lacks energy return",
  "RR_verdict": "We found that the Merrell Moab Flight offers great value, especially for heel strikers who benefit from its high drop. In our lab tests, we were pleased to see that despite its budget-friendly price, it still features a Vibram outsole and a plush, comfort-focused upper. During testing, the shoe felt flexible and well-suited for hiking. However, we don’t recommend it for those wanting a bouncy midsole or better breathability—its firm foam and heavily padded upper make it a poor choice for hot weather and runners looking for energy return.",
