  "brand": "Saucony",
  "total_score": "90",
  "pros": "Massive weight reduction; Superb breathability; Responsive ride; Good option as an everyday shoe; PWRRUN+ insole; Great vertical room for toe movement; Same price as v17; Fantastic step-in feel; No heel slippage at all",
  "cons": "Narrow for wide-footer runners; Not the best on wet roads; Low outsole coverage",
  "RR_verdict": "The Saucony Ride 18 fixes the two major issues we had with the v17 by delivering an airy upper and a noticeably lighter feel on foot. We found that it keeps the same springy-and-durable midsole and retains its reasonable price tag. While grip could be better and we wished for a roomier toebox during our long runs, we think this is one of the most value-loaded daily trainers available on the market right now.",
