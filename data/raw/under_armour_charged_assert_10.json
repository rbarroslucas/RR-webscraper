  "brand": "Under Armour",
  "total_score": "81",
  "pros": "Exceptionally comfortable and adaptable; Expanded width for added room in the toebox; Outsole is just built to last; Ample cushioning catering to heel strikers; Tailored for heel strikers; Doubles as a cross-training or gym shoe; Great value for the price; Offers stable landings at slower paces",
  "cons": "Ride leans towards the firm side, lacking in bounce; A bit on the heavy side; Still not the best for midfoot or forefoot strikers; Slippery on wet surfaces",
  "RR_verdict": "The Under Armour Charged Assert 10, a minor upgrade from its predecessor, is a dream partner for a firm and robust run. Designed with heel strikers in mind, it's a little bit heavy but delivers a stable ride. In our view, if you are in search of a shoe with an ultra-sturdy outsole and a firm ride, this affordable UA is second to none.",
