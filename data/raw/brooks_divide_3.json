  "RR_verdict": "The Brooks Divide 3 stands out as one of our top picks for door-to-trail shoes. With its complete makeover and budget-friendly price, we found it capable of tackling almost any situation—trails or roads alike. We were really surprised by its stability and build quality, though the ride felt incredibly firm and lacks enough cushion for longer distances.",
