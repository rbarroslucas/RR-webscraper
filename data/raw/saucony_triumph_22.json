  "brand": "Saucony",
  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Premium cozy upper; Bouncy, propulsive midsole; Excels at easy or moderate long runs; Roomy toebox; Solid durability; Great for heel strikers; Tons of cushioning; Fairly priced for its features",
  "cons": "A bit clunky; Lacks breathability; Increased stiffness",
  "RR_verdict": "The Triumph 22 receives arguably its most significant upgrade in a decade with the introduction of the long-awaited PWRRUN PB midsole, which delivers incredible energy return. We were also thrilled to find that it now offers more stability and maintains a decent weight. And Saucony has really raised the bar with the quality and plushness of the upper. While there are minor points of concern, like weight and increased stiffness, these weren't major drawbacks for us.",
