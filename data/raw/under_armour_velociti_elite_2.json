  "brand": "Under Armour",
  "total_score": "83",
  "pros": "Ultra-breathable upper; Snappy, rigid carbon plate; Outstanding traction on dry surfaces; Wide toebox (for a racer); Smooth transitions for midfoot strikers; Complies with World Athletics; Built for the marathon distance; TPE insole for added responsiveness",
  "cons": "Not a real supershoe; Heavier than most rivals; Midsole lacks top-tier energy return; Outsole durability is a major concern",
  "RR_verdict": "Under Armour set out to create a true supershoe with the Velociti Elite 2, but in our experience, it misses the mark. We found that while the Pebax layer provides a lively, race-ready feel, the EVA foam beneath the plate dulls energy return. The grip and fit are solid, but the shoe's excessive weight prevents it from being truly competitive. Given its premium price, we believe it struggles to justify itself against lighter, full-superfoam alternatives that dominate everything from 5Ks to marathons.",
