  "brand": "Nike",
  "total_score": "86",
  "pros": "Exceptionally breathable upper; Outstanding ZoomX cushioning; Superb choice from the mile to the marathon; Impressively low weight; Enhanced stability; Plush, cloud-like foam; Upgraded outsole for better grip",
  "cons": "Uncomfortably large tongue; The heel is still too narrow",
  "RR_verdict": "In our opinion, Nike's latest Vaporfly marks a significant upgrade in the \"original supershoe\" concept. This third iteration, lighter, swifter, and more stable during all of our runs, is a marathon marvel, yet its softer midsole and gentler toe-off make it less suited (but still great!) for 5K/10K races than its predecessors. Faithful to its roots, it elevates the winning combination of a spoon-shaped carbon plate, a springy Pebax midsole, and a lightweight build. And still priced at $250, it remains a high-performance dream for all running aficionados.",
