  "pros": "Remains lightweight; Excels at all paces; Great for track workouts; More spacious fit; Bouncy and enjoyable ride; Enhanced stability over v3; Suits daily training; Exceptional value",
  "cons": "Slightly heavier than predecessor; Could be a bit firm for some",
  "RR_verdict": "By enhancing the predecessor's weaker aspects while preserving the model's essence, Saucony has hit the mark again with the Endorphin Speed 4. In our tests, we found this supertrainer to still be a lightweight, bouncy, and versatile shoe that easily adapts to all paces. It's now even more cushioned and spacious, making it more comfortable than ever in long runs. Despite a slight increase in weight and a lacing system that might not suit everyone, we're still eager to recommend the ES4 for its outstanding value and performance.",
