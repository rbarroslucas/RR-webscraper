  "brand": "Nike",
  "total_score": "91",
  "pros": "Amazing step-in feel; First max-stack Vomero; Price drop from v17!; ZoomX + ReactX combo works really well; Ideal for recovery runs; Ideal for heel strikers; Still quite stable despite its size; Comfortable upper",
  "cons": "Needs to lose some weight; Narrow toebox; Lacks agility for faster paces; Grip could be better",
  "RR_verdict": "The Vomero 18 received a much-needed, full-scale overhaul to match today’s trend of max-cushioned trainers. We found it now delivers more foam underfoot and step-in comfort than ever, paired with a rare price drop we all appreciate. However, it’s not all good news—it also packed on extra weight, became noticeably less flexible, and its grip still trails behind the competition.",
