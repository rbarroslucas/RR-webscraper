  "total_score": "87",
  "pros": "Impressively lightweight design; Offers a stable ride; Excellent traction on easy trails; Ideal for midfoot and forefoot strikers; The SkyVault plate provides both protection and bounce; Durable, long-lasting outsole; Perfect for faster paces",
  "cons": "The upper might be too narrow for many runners; Lacks sufficient cushioning for longer distances; Not for technical terrain",
  "RR_verdict": "In our experience, the Brooks Catamount 2 is a great trail running shoe, but it comes with a few compromises. It's not designed for wide feet or technical terrain, and it's not the best for long distances. However, if these factors don't bother you, we believe this shoe offers a stable ride in a lightweight package. We were also impressed with the bouncy DNA Flash midsole and its outstanding performance on easy trails like fire roads, even at uptempo paces. We think that for runners who fit its specific profile, the Catamount 2 could be a great choice even at $170, combining speed with comfort in a way that's hard to beat.",
