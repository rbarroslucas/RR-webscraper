  "pros": "Super-flexible build; Good durability; Low stack height; Sock-like comfortable upper; Cushioned heel; Vibram outsole; Great value; Works for road and trail running",
  "cons": "Limited toe splay; Non-removable insole reduces customization; Lacks a zero-drop geometry",
  "RR_verdict": "We found it refreshing to see a traditional brand like New Balance still making true minimalist shoes. The MT10 mixes a classic running shoe fit with a moderate drop and a super-thin midsole. In our experience, it felt light, very flexible, and great for trail or road runs. The Vibram outsole grips well, and we believe it’s also a solid choice for anyone transitioning toward barefoot shoes. However, we really wish the toebox was wider and had more room for toe splay!",
