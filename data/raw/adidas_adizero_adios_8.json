  "RR_verdict": "The Adizero Adios line may have fallen out of favor since its marathon record-breaking early days, but in our opinion, the Adios 8 is definitely a step in the right direction in bringing the series back into the good graces of performance runners. This shoe delivers an old-school, nimble ride that reminds us of simpler times before the proliferation of carbon-plated super shoes on the starting line.",
