  "pros": "Amazing weight reduction; Better running experience than v2; Reasonably priced; Suitable for walking; Cushions long runs; Breathable upper; Exceptional all-around comfort",
  "cons": "No more Continental; Lacks energy return; Upper needs better durability",
  "RR_verdict": "The Adidas Adistar 3 introduces significant changes, featuring increased bounce and a lighter design—we really noticed these improvements on our runs. However, it does come with substantial drawbacks; the stability is reduced, and the superior Continental outsole, known for its durability and grip, is missing. Despite these issues, it remains a cost-effective option, even more affordable than the Pegasus!",
