  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Softer, more comfortable upper; Breathable; Excellent lockdown; Good guidance without being too intrusive; Protective and fairly responsive; Good grip; Natural-feeling ride; Roomy toe box; Lightweight; Best for daily miles and as a walking shoe",
  "cons": "Uncomfortable for going sockless; Firm cushioning; Does not like to go fast; Durability is so-so",
  "RR_verdict": "Having tested Guide 16, we found that it continues to be the mild-to-moderate stability shoe that helps to meet runners' pronation needs. We noticed that this lightweight runner toes the line between traditional and modern guidance—offering the type of support that’s slightly reminiscent of posted models thanks to its many stability elements, while also keeping a relatively low-key, ‘there when you need it’ presence underfoot.",
  "awards": "Top pick in best running shoes for plantar fasciitis (2023), Top pick in best stability running shoes (2023)",
