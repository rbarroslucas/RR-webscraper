  "RR_verdict": "Crafting a minimalist, zero-drop running shoe that thrives on trails is no small feat, and Merrell continues to excel with its Trail Glove series. In its seventh version, we tested a true zero-drop trail shoe that's perfect for both beginners and veterans of barefoot running. We were struck by its durable upper, exceptional stability, and remarkable agility in cornering, along with the Vibram outsole that offers superb grip. However, we did find the outsole's durability to be lacking. Overall, the Merrell Trail Glove 7 stands out as a fun and unique choice, perfect as a running and hiking companion for the minimalist aficionado.",
