  "total_score": "87",
  "pros": "Insanely lightweight; Awesome racing-flat vibes; Perfect for tempo workouts; Promotes feet strength; Grippy outsole in wet and dry surfaces; Reasonably priced; Amazing airflow; Can double for track workouts",
  "cons": "Not the best for heel strikers; Still not the most responsive midsole",
  "RR_verdict": "The Brooks Hyperion 2 merges the nostalgia of a classic racing flat with modern features, making it a fantastic pick for those seeking a fast, grounded feel. We found it incredibly lightweight and flexible, keeping each stride incredibly fun. The breathable, state-of-the-art upper adds a nice touch, all for a reasonable price point. And while we think the midsole still needs more energy return, it’s a standout choice for those looking to avoid maximalist running shoes.",
