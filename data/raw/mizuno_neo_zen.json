  "pros": "Plush and bouncy foam; Feather-light for a max-stack trainer; Fun, agile ride; Ideal for long runs; Solid value for performance; Comfortable and breathable ﻿knit upper; Toebox resist heavy wear; Eye-catching design; Outsole grips and lasts",
  "cons": "Wobbly for those needing support; Heel sink slows rearfoot strikers; Upper lacks padding and structure; Enerzy NXT firms up in cold conditions",
  "RR_verdict": "Mizuno is back in style, and the Neo Zen proves it loud and clear. We loved the breathable knit upper and the thick, cushion-packed Enerzy NXT foam that made every step feel soft and smooth. It’s surprisingly lightweight for such a high-stack trainer, and that helps it feel quick at faster paces too. While it might not be the best pick for heel strikers or runners who need extra stability, we think this fun-looking, ultra-plush daily trainer is a strong choice for easy miles and long runs alike.",
