  "total_score": "86",
  "pros": "Foot-shaped toebox; Exceptional ground feel; Fairly priced at $90; Highly responsive and agile; Extremely flexible design; Maintains grip, even on wet surfaces; Sockless ready; Perfect for road running or tackling easy trails; Versatile enough for hiking, walking, or even gym workouts",
  "cons": "Overly spacious for those with narrow feet; Outsole shows wear quickly; The cushioned insole detracts from a true barefoot experience",
  "RR_verdict": "The sixth edition of Merrell's Vapor Glove returns, now offering enhanced comfort to complement the barefoot experience. Although originally designed for easy trails, we were thrilled to find this minimalist runner just as exceptional on the road and in the gym. Despite its $90 price tag, which might suggest a basic level, the shoe's comfort, grip, and performance were outstanding in our lab. However, we noticed the outsole could wear down quickly, and the fit may be too spacious for those with narrow feet. Based on our tests, the Vapor Glove 6 stands out as an authentic zero-drop option, offering great value for its price.",
