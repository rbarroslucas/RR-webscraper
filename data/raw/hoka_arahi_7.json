  "total_score": "82",
  "pros": "Premium and comfy upper; Still surprisingly light; Subtle yet effective stability features; Versatile for all footstrikes; Reasonably priced; Excellent fit and security; Plush tongue; Cushioned",
  "cons": "Limited breathability; Low energy return; Only for narrow feet; Grip could be better",
  "RR_verdict": "The Hoka Arahi 7, with its mild stability, really shines for those who favor a snug upper alongside a firm midsole. Despite its incredibly comfy knit upper and solid stability, it's not a shoe for everyone—it's tailored for specific runners. We found that this version has a unique ride and feel, setting it apart from previous Arahis, so don't expect an automatic match—we advise being ready for something different!",
