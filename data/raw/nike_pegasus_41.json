  "RR_verdict": "Nike's updates can be unpredictable, but we can confidently say that the Pegasus 41 is a standout. We were particularly impressed by its features for heel strikers, enhanced by the new plush foam and rockered sole. The shoe maintains its renowned durability too. And despite the $10 price increase, we believe it's justified and well worth it. At the end of the day, although it's been quite some time since 1982—I wasn't even born then!—the Pegasus series is still kicking, and for good reason.",
