  "total_score": "81",
  "pros": "Great impact protection; Bounce midsole foam at the heel provides a premium feeling ride; Good for walking, gym days, as well as easy runs; Remarkably stable underfoot; Grippy and durable outsole; Budget friendly; Stylish and sustainable design",
  "cons": "Very heavy for a road shoe; Breathability could be better; Tapered toebox; Lacking in upper durability",
  "RR_verdict": "In my opinion, the Alphabounce+ is a daily trainer cunningly disguised as a stylish sneaker. Its ace-in-the-hole is the Bounce midsole foam found at the heel that delivers a premium feeling ride at a bargain-bin price. Despite being on the heavier side, this workhorse provides me with stability and comfort in my casual runs, days at the gym, or just moseying around town.",
