  "RR_verdict": "The Adidas 4DFWD impressed us from the start with its jaw-dropping midsole. Although molded as running footwear, we believe that it wins the lifestyle category for its all-day cozy steps and striking looks. With its overall performance and admirable eco-friendly make-up, this kick is a real treat for our feet. At the same time, this innovative approach to cushioning can also work for moderate running.",
