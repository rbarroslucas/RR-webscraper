  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Great value; Versatile across various paces; Cushioned ride; PureGEL heel insert; Enhanced stability; True all-rounder; Lightweight for its category",
  "cons": "Outsole durability issues; Limited traction off-road; Lacks breathability",
  "RR_verdict": "We think the ASICS Cumulus 26 is a solid, versatile daily trainer that provides good cushioning and handles multiple paces and distances well. However, fans of previous models might be disappointed with changes that affect the shoe's rigidity and the new rubberized EVA outsole—a notable shift from earlier versions. And while we find it to be a superb pick for the average runner, it may not satisfy those who prefer a more flexible and natural ride.",
