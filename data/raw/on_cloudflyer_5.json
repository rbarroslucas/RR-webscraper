  "pros": "Superior build quality; Plush, all-day comfort; Great for walking and running; Breathable yet durable upper; Excellent stability; Improved outsole; Best Cloudflyer to date; Superb lockdown",
  "cons": "Pricey for its performance; Firm midsole; It's H-E-A-V-Y",
  "RR_verdict": "The On Cloudflyer 5 left us with mixed feelings—while it's exceptionally comfortable, it also feels noticeably heavy and lacks energy in its ride. We were impressed by its premium construction and reliable stability, making it ideal as a casual sneaker or for occasional runners seeking a solid, well-built shoe. However, given its high price and firm midsole, we believe it won’t satisfy those looking for a lively or responsive running experience.",
