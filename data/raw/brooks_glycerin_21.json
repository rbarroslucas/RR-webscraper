  "RR_verdict": "The Glycerin has been a mainstay in Brooks' lineup for over two decades for good reasons. In our tests, we found that the 21st version stands out as the best yet—boasting enhanced cushioning, a robust outsole, and unmatched comfort from the first mile. It’s particularly suitable for heel strikers, providing a stable ride that excels on long runs. However, we also noted that it might polarize some runners, primarily catering to rearfoot strikers and being too warm for hot summer runs.",
