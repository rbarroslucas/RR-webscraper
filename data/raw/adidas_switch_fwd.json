  "pros": "Head-turning design; Great for jogs and easy runs; Excellent as a walking shoe; Delightful cushioning; Nice and flexible; Surprisingly stable ride; Comfortable and secure heel-hold; Above average breathability; Durable and grippy outsole",
  "cons": "Quite heavy; Not very responsive; Not ideal for speedwork or long-distances; Outsole voids trap debris",
  "RR_verdict": "“Holy Cow!” was the predominant thought we had when unboxing this monstrosity from Adidas. While it’s certainly more geared toward sneaker-heads looking for an eye-catching fashion accessory, we were pleasantly surprised with how it performed during our test runs. As such, the Switch FWD lives up to its name through its ability to switch between being a comfy city slicker and a reliable daily trainer.",
