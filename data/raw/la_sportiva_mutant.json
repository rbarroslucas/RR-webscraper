  "cons": "Unquestionably heavy; Potential for rapid outsole wear; Excessively firm midsole",
  "RR_verdict": "The La Sportiva Mutant stands out as a fierce trail running shoe, built for stability on technical terrain. In our tests, we found it excels in the wildest runs. However, its performance dips on easier terrains, so it's more of a specialized, high-drop tool in your rotation rather than the ultimate do-it-all trail shoe. Its specific design is matched with a unique, eye-catching look that's bound to split opinions among everyone. And while it's not the lightest option out there, we believe that its rugged construction and exceptional grip make it a formidable choice for those challenging, technical trails.",
