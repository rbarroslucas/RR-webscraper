  "pros": "Cushioned for heavier runners; Tuned for overpronators; Super stable, wide platform; Extremely durable; Plush, padded upper; Roomy toebox",
  "cons": "A bit too stiff; Heavy; Tongue bunches up",
  "RR_verdict": "Heavily padded, and cushioned, and keeps my feet's motions in check, it doesn't get any more stable than the Gaviota 3 from Hoka! With all the cushion and support it provides, I found this motion control running shoe not only suits overpronators but also heavy runners. If there's a stability version of the Bondi, it's THIS. Ultimately, it's a shoe I recommend for daily runs rather than fast, uptempo paces.",
