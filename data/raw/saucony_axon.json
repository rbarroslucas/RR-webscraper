  "RR_verdict": "Built off of the Saucony Endorphin, the Saucony Axon really pushed me forward! It's a fast-transitioning neutral daily trainer that's rockered and rolls me through my strides effortlessly. It's also for the budget-conscious runners who think that performance shouldn't come at a steep price. Even better, you don't have to worry about paying another full price in a short span of time, because I verified through wear and lab tests that this is a REALLY durable shoe that will eat up 400-500 miles.",
