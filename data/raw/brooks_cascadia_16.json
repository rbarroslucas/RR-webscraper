  "RR_verdict": "Brooks' venerable trail crusher is updated in this 16 version of the Cascadia. If you demand a stout grip, a stable platform, and bright colors, I encourage you to take a look at the Cascadia 16. It’s true to size, durable as hell, and packed with features like a ballistic rock plate, lace loop, and enough upper-lacing eyelets that ensure a custom fit. Testing them on my runs, I found these aggressive kicks ready for adventure!",
