  "brand": "New Balance",
  "total_score": "87",
  "pros": "Plush, comfortable midsole; Snug-fitting yet comfortable upper; Smooth, rockered ride; Versatile for all paces; Durable and grippy outsole; Reliable lockdown; Amazing for long runs",
  "cons": "Limited energy return; Not the best for racing; Lacing system could be better",
  "RR_verdict": "The New Balance FuelCell SuperComp Elite v3 left us wanting more in terms of performance—its midsole wasn't as springy as we'd hoped, especially when stacked against the latest supershoes. However, during our long runs and tempo sessions, it truly stood out as a wonderful partner. We think those in search of top-tier performance might find it lacking, but for runners seeking a versatile shoe that's up for the occasional race, it's a strong contender.",
