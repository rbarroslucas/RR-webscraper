  "RR_verdict": "Whether it's a long-distance or recovery shoe you're after, I highly recommend the Clifton 8. It's a literal couch to the foot, keeping it cozy and stable. The ride is also buttery smooth, you will roll through seamlessly. And with all the cushion it gives, it's not at all heavy (a shocker really). Overall, the Clifton is a literal bag of treats that comes at a moderate price!",
