  "total_score": "82",
  "pros": "Responsive midsole; Natural barefoot feeling ride; Low to the ground and stable; Doubles as a reliable hiking shoe; Breathable and durable ripstop upper mesh; Secure midfoot lockdown; Accommodating toebox; Generously padded and comfy; Dries quickly; Gaiter attachment ready",
  "cons": "Not so grippy in wet conditions; Subpar outsole durability",
  "RR_verdict": "The eighth edition of Altra's standout Lone Peak series brings back everything we love about its previous iterations but updated with a commendably tough ripstop mesh upper. With its secure yet accommodating toebox and flexible ride, the Lone Peak 8 feels like an extension of our foot whether we take it for runs through the trails or prolonged hiking adventures. That said, the shoe also inherits some of its predecessor's cons like the Max-Trac outsole's lackluster durability and subpar grip in wet conditions.",
