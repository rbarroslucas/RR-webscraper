  "cons": "Durability issues; Not for heel strikers; Limited breathability",
  "RR_verdict": "Based on our analysis, the Altra Outroad 3 is a versatile pick for casual runners and travelers seeking an all-in-one shoe. We found it transitions seamlessly from trails to roads, making it perfect for those who love zero-drop designs. Its spacious, foot-shaped toebox provides excellent comfort for wider feet, while the MaxTrac outsole grips well on varied surfaces. However, durability in the outsole and heel is noticeably lacking, and both areas need significant improvement to fully achieve its door-to-trail potential.",
