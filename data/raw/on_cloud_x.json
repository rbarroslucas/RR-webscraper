  "RR_verdict": "The On Cloud X sets itself apart from today's high-stack running shoes, embodying a multifaceted approach. We found it effortlessly adapts to everything from relaxed walks with your dog to easy and aerobic runs. Its versatility also shines in cross-training and gym workouts. However, we think long-distance runs may be a step too far for the Cloud X, due to its modest cushioning and firm midsole.",
