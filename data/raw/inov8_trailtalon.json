  "pros": "Ideal for those with wide feet; Grippy outsole for wild terrain; Impressively flexible; Plush TPU insole; Good lockdown; Agile feel underfoot; Ready for long adventures; Great for hiking too",
  "cons": "Poor toebox durability; Falls short on breathability; Lacks stability",
  "RR_verdict": "The Inov8 Trailtalon is a great trail shoe made for runners who want a fun ride on rough and uneven terrain. We really liked how the wide toebox gave our toes space to move naturally, especially during long runs. On our test runs through wet and rocky paths, it felt really playful—perfect for those who prefer an agile design instead of a bulky one. However, we did find a few issues in the lab: durability and breathability weren’t great, and runners who need extra stability might want to look elsewhere.",
