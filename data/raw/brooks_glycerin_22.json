  "pros": "DNA Tuned improves cushioning; Stable ride; Highly-breathable upper; Increased stack height; All-around comfort; First-class durability; Perfect for everyday miles; Awesome for heel strikers; Great as an everyday shoe",
  "cons": "Needs to lose some weight; Low toebox height; Price increase; Not the most energetic ride",
  "RR_verdict": "The Glycerin 22 remains an easy recommendation for those seeking a durable, comfort-loaded daily trainer. In our lab tests, we found that Brooks refined the formula with an upgraded DNA Tuned foam, a higher stack height, and an ultra-breathable upper—all while preserving stability. However, it’s not all bells and whistles, as we found that version 22 is heavier, pricier, and stiffer than before, which may not appeal to everyone.",
