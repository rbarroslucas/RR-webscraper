  "RR_verdict": "We think the Hyperion GTS 2 brings a fresh and focused take to stability shoes. We were impressed by how agile it felt on our runs, offering just the right touch of stability without slowing things down. The shoe performed well in the lab and even better out on the road, especially for runners who enjoy ground contact. However, we believe it’s not the best match for long runs or forefoot strikers, as the high drop and thin front cushioning made it feel a bit harsh up front.",
