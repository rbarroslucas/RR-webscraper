  "brand": "New Balance",
  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Flexible design; Comfortable, high-quality upper; Exceptional durability; Perfect for easy paces; Also suitable for neutral runners; Excellent for long runs; Reasonably priced",
  "cons": "Noticeably heavy; Limited breathability; Not the best for heel strikers",
  "RR_verdict": "The New Balance Fresh Foam X Vongo v6 emerges as an interesting choice in the evolving landscape of mild-stability shoes—packed with modern features like a EVA plate and unobtrusive support that might let down those needing serious stability, yet it offers a remarkably comfy yet supportive ride. In our view it still needs another diet, and with its 6 mm drop and current dimensions, we believe it’s better suited for forefoot and midfoot strikers.",
