  "brand": "Saucony",
  "total_score": "86",
  "pros": "Insanely comfortable; Low to the ground and stable; Great midfoot lockdown; Good for walking and gym; Extremely breathable; No break-in period; Lightweight; Really durable; Visible at night",
  "cons": "Not a running shoe per se; Stiff ride; Heel slips",
  "RR_verdict": "If the Saucony Freedom 4 was judged by its comfort alone, then I believe this would be a top-notch shoe. But it is meant as a running shoe and I found that it just falls short on performance. But if you're on the lookout for a daily trainer that prides itself in keeping the foot cozy, while being durable and light, then take the Saucony Freedom. It won't disappoint in such areas.",
