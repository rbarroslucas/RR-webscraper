  "pros": "Exceptionally stable; Excels on nearly all dry terrains; Lower stack height offers a more natural ride; Adaptable across various running paces; Reasonably priced; Excellent performance in winter conditions; Incredibly durable outsole; Comfortable upper",
  "cons": "Lacks a rock plate; Not suitable for ultras; Too rigid for technical trails",
  "RR_verdict": "Our review revealed the Hoka Torrent 3 as a harmoniously balanced and affordably priced option from Hoka. Perfect for smoother trails such as fire roads or gravel paths, this shoe shines with its lightweight build, stable ProFly foam, and a durable outsole. Yet, for longer distances or technical trails, it falls short in providing the necessary cushioning and grip. While we believe it may not be the go-to shoe for die-hard trail enthusiasts or ultramarathon runners, it stands out as a versatile and dependable choice for many runners.",
