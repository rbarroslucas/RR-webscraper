  "total_score": "86",
  "pros": "Grippier than ever before; Ready for a rough beating; Lighter than ever; Seamless heel-to-toe; Stable during sharp turns; Buttery soft; Welcomes wide feet; Tongue stays in place; Also for hiking!",
  "cons": "Not enough airflow; Forefoot lacks cushion",
  "RR_verdict": "The Hierro v7 from New Balance is dubbed as the trail version of the NB 1080. Although New Balance has touted it as a road-to-trail option, with its multi-terrain grip, we have found it to be more trail-specific. If you enjoyed previous iterations of the Hierro, you will surely appreciate the lightened version 7. We think that it is a fantastic do-it-all trail running shoe that makes you want to rack up more miles.",
