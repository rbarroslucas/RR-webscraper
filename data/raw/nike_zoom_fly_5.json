  "RR_verdict": "The fifth version of the Nike Zoom Fly series shifts its focus from fast to far. We found it to be reassuringly stable and now capable of easier runs far better than before. Although it's a miss on weight, we love that the grip and protection are supreme in the Zoom Fly 5 from Nike.",
