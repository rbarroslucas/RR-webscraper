  "RR_verdict": "The Nike Flex Experience Run 12 remains a top pick for anyone seeking a natural, minimalist feel without going full zero-drop. We loved the flexibility for both walking and running, and how it effortlessly doubles as a gym shoe. While the cushioning might feel a bit too firm, and the outsole does show wear, we think its incredibly low price and overall comfort make it a great choice for various runners, especially beginners wanting a versatile, do-it-all shoe.",
