  "RR_verdict": "The Gel Kayano has been around us since 1993 and is more alive than ever. After surviving a risky update last year, we found that ASICS has built on its solid foundations by adding subtle improvements to the upper, stability, weight, and fit. It's still a big and heavy shoe, but its plush midsole compensates a bit for this. For us, it's again one of the top stability shoes on the market, and we wouldn't be surprised if it reaches another 31 editions!",
