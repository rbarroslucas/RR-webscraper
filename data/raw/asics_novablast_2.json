  "RR_verdict": "Built around comfort, my feet are right at home in the ASICS Novablast 2! It's springy and soft (as in everywhere!) - much like a spa day treat in long, easy miles. And with all that plushness, you might think this is a shoe that wears easily. Good news! I confirmed that it DOESN'T. It's able to eat up miles (300-500 miles)!",
