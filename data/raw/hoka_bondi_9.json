  "brand": "HOKA",
  "total_score": "90",
  "pros": "Endless cushioning; New supercritical EVA midsole; Amazing step-in comfort; Doubles as a walking shoe; Stable for its height; Built to last; Excels at slow-and-steady paces; Well-designed heel collar; Lighter than v8",
  "cons": "Not for wide feet; Still feels heavy and clunky underfoot; Drop measurement differs from stated; Non-gusseted tongue",
  "RR_verdict": "The Bondi 9 arrived after a long wait, and we found Hoka prioritized consistency to maintain the v8’s winning formula. In our lab tests, we discovered it to be a better version in every way—lighter, more durable, and packed with improved cushioning. The new supercritical foam is definitely bouncier, while the upper materials provide a premium fit. However, its narrow toebox, oversized frame, and hefty build still limit its appeal for many runners.",
