  "brand": "New Balance",
  "total_score": "84",
  "pros": "Reasonably priced; Ultra-soft, responsive midsole; Includes a carbon plate; Ideal for marathon training; Great stability; Premium upper delivers great fit; Fantastic for midfoot strikers",
  "cons": "Increased weight; Still not 100% PEBA foam; Midsole groove traps pebbles; Upper durability",
  "RR_verdict": "The SC Trainer v3 is New Balance's latest iteration aimed at perfecting the series, and we think they're finally on the right track. In our testing, we found it to be the best version yet, offering outstanding stability, impressive grip, and better energy return than its predecessors. It's also priced well, enhancing its appeal. However, we see room for even further enhancements; the midsole doesn't quite reach the performance of fully PEBA-based supertrainers, and its weight is a tad high for the stack height offered.",
