  "RR_verdict": "When comfort is the top priority, look no further than the Saucony Triumph 19. We enjoyed this plush, luxurious shoe on our cruiser runs, long runs, and recovery days, thanks to its padded upper and insanely soft landing midsole. This year’s Triumph gets a few big updates too, both losing a ton of weight and becoming nice and breathable. Your legs and feet will thank you the next time you lace up the Triumph 19!",
