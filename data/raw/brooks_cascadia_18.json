  "cons": "Noticeable durability issues; Midsole lacks bounce and softness; Still on the heavier side; No reflective elements",
  "RR_verdict": "We found the Brooks Cascadia 18 to be a solid evolution, with small, thoughtful updates that enhance its performance for trail runners, particularly heel strikers. Although it could benefit from shedding a bit more weight and a bouncier midsole, we were impressed by its exceptional value. In our lab tests, we found it delivers excellent stability, reliable traction, and a comfortable fit that makes it suitable for both trail runs and casual hikes.",
