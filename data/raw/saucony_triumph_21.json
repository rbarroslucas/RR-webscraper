  "RR_verdict": "The Saucony Triumph 21, building on its legacy, offered us in the lab the smooth ride that enthusiasts have always cherished from this saga. This year's version provides unprecedented cushioning, an upgraded PWRRUN+ midsole, and a breathable knit upper. While its outsole intelligently balances weight and durability with strategic cutouts, in our experience, this shoe truly excels as a jack-of-all-trades, particularly for those with wide feet, thanks to its broad design.",
