  "total_score": "90",
  "pros": "Max-cushioned comfort; Ultra-spacious toebox; Stable ride; Premium Ortholite footbed; Midfoot-friendly geometry; Lightweight for its huge size; Great for easy long runs; No heel slippage",
  "cons": "Lacks energy return; Not for narrow-footed runners; Could be a bit more flexible",
  "RR_verdict": "Topo finally steps into the max-cushioned category, and in our experience, the Atmos is a strong first effort. We found it delivers a stable, well-balanced ride with the brand’s signature anatomical toebox and moderate drop—perfect for midfoot and forefoot strikers. However, its energy return lags behind top-tier competitors, and the outsole design raises some durability concerns. That said, we think this is a promising start for Topo in the high-stack daily trainer space, with room for refinement.",
