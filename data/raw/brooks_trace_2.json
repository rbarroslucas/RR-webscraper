  "pros": "Outstanding value for just $100; Comfortable BioMoGo DNA midsole; Superior breathability; Ideal for heel strikers; Incredibly light; Remarkably durable; Performs well in all seasons; Versatile enough for gym or walking use",
  "cons": "Inadequate cushioning for forefoot strikers; Limited energy return",
  "RR_verdict": "The Brooks Trace 2 shines as a budget-friendly yet high-performing daily trainer, especially for heel strikers. It boasts a competent midsole, cozy mesh upper, and impressive durability. Adding to its appeal, we found during our test runs that it can easily transition from the road to the gym, thanks to its snug fit and moderate cushioning. While it may fall short in the energy return department, it's a small hiccup considering the overall value.",
