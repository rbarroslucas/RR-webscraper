  "pros": "Enhanced midsole; Fantastic stability; Ideal for long-distance training; All-day comfort; Great choice for heel strikers; Generous, roomy upper; Reasonable weight; Well-ventilated upper",
  "cons": "Lacks Continental rubber; Durability concerns; Not for narrow feet",
  "RR_verdict": "Adidas has completely overhauled the Supernova series, and the Prima is their top-tier model for those seeking robust cushioning, a spacious upper, and stable ride—all wrapped in a reasonably lightweight package. However, in our lab tests, we noted that the outsole lacks the durability and grip of Continental rubber, which Adidas often uses on other models. For a premium daily trainer, this absence is hard to overlook.",
