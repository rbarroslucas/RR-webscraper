  "total_score": "90",
  "pros": "No longer catches stones in the outsole; Extremely light and nimble; Effective rockered geometry; Provides a stable ride; Comfortable and durable upper; High-quality materials; Suitable for interval training speeds",
  "cons": "Likely too expensive for the features provided; The foam may be excessively firm",
  "RR_verdict": "The On Cloudflow 4.0 emerges as an impressive evolution from its predecessor, albeit catering to a niche audience with its firm midsole and form-fitting upper, sidelining a significant number of runners. Priced steeply at $160, we think it excels as a versatile neutral shoe for those it fits, delivering stability and a responsive, rockered run. Furthermore, the fact that it's one of the lightest daily trainers on the market enhances its attractiveness, in our view.",
