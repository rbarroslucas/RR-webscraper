  "cons": "Too much ground feel for some; Heavier than most; Grip isn’t reliable in wet conditions",
  "RR_verdict": "With less flair than many modern alternatives, I couldn't deny that the Merrell Nova 2 is a traditionally designed trail running shoe. However, in my personal encounters with its versatility and grip, I verified its position as one of the best trail running shoes for beginners.",
