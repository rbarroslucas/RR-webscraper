  "brand": "Saucony",
  "total_score": "90",
  "pros": "Enhanced stability features; Improved stack height; Lightweight; Fairly priced; Smoother transitions with new rocker; Premium PWRRUN+ sockliner",
  "cons": "Grip could be better; Less agile than before; Exposed midsole",
  "RR_verdict": "The Guide 17 is a significant evolution from its predecessors. We put it to the test and were impressed by Saucony's departure from traditional stability features, offering a rockered ride. And despite a slight decrease in agility from its wider midsole, the shoe still maintains a competitive weight. Therefore, we believe it's a great upgrade, standing out as a top choice for anyone in search of a modern stability shoe that's reasonably priced.",
