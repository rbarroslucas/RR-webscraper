  "brand": "On",
  "total_score": "81",
  "pros": "Improved durability from v1; Versatile for hiking and walking; High-quality materials; Great for flat and easy trails; Rockered design enables a smooth transition; Fantastic for midfoot strikers; Superb stability; Not overly expensive",
  "cons": "Firm feel underfoot; Tongue lacks comfort; Slight weight increase",
  "RR_verdict": "The On Cloudvista 2 strikes a balance between strengths and compromises, making it suitable for certain trail runners. During our tests, we found its firm underfoot feel, reduced ventilation, and pronounced rocker less suited for technical routes or hot days. That said, it shines on simple trails, delivering a smooth ride and impressive warmth from its premium upper. In our opinion, it’s a solid option for those who prefer firm midsoles and trail adventures in cooler climates.",
