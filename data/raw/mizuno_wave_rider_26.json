  "pros": "Comfortable and breathable upper; Cushioned ride, especially for heel strikers; Lightweight; Good lockdown; Great traction on most surfaces; Durable; Dependable daily trainer; Classy and conservative design; Eco-friendly",
  "cons": "Tight around toes; Sky-high heel drop; Needs some breaking in; Not for fast paces",
  "RR_verdict": "Traditional must be the best way we can describe the Mizuno Wave Rider 26 in a word. It’s a straightforward, no-frills trainer that does its job and does it well. Although not everyone can be a fan of its 12-mm heel drop, we think that its comfortable, well-cushioned, smooth, and durable build will find its audience.",
