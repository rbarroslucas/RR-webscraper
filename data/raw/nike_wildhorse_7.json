  "cons": "Runs hot; Not for technical terrain; Not for wet conditions; Gaiters look better than they work",
  "RR_verdict": "Pacing it through rocky and off-trail terrain, hands down, the Nike Wildhorse 7 just rocks! It made our steps confident and its protection just took everything to a whole new level. For a trail shoe, this is what we consider comfortable. It's not pillowy soft but has enough give to keep the foot cushioned and strain-free. All of this, however, comes at the price of heft.",
