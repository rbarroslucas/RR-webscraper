  "pros": "Premium Continental rubber; Explosive energy return; Breathable race-ready upper; Propulsive EnergyRods and rocker combo; Perfect for midfoot strikers; Explosive toe-off with extreme rocker; Built to conquer ultra distances; Excellent implementation of Lightstrike Pro; Durable materials; Excellent laces",
  "cons": "Unstable on technical terrain; Heel collar design needs improvements; Not a good pick for rearfoot strikers; Not for wide feet",
  "RR_verdict": "We found the Adidas Terrex Agravic Speed Ultra to be a wild ride—like a Ferrari with all-terrain tyres. Its bouncy Lightstrike Pro midsole, grippy Continental rubber, and race-ready upper make it perfect for midfoot and forefoot strikers who fly over easy trails. We were impressed by its aggressive rocker, fueling nonstop forward momentum. However, its super-tight midfoot and minimal heel support aren’t ideal for everyone. But if you match the fit and terrain, this trail supershoe feels incredible.",
