  "RR_verdict": "The classic speedster feel of the Brooks Levitate 5 gives us the impression that we are brought back to the glory days of stiff shoes equaling quicker paces. Before super shoes, carbon plates, and hydrogen-infused foams this is how tempo shoes were built. To go fast, we had to focus on our form, and not rely on the shoes to make up for any deficiencies, so we found it most appropriate for short distances. Not everyone needs or wants bouncy shoes, anyway, as some still like to feel the ground, and push their legs with heart rather than technology!",
