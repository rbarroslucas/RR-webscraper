  "pros": "Mild stability; Wide toebox; Familiar Saucony fit; Good grip; Perfect midfoot lockdown; Really durable",
  "cons": "Uninspired ride; Heel slipping; A bit heavy",
  "RR_verdict": "A stability shoe made for training runs, I found that Guide 14 from Saucony just gets the job done. No frills, no gimmicks, just plain support. While it may be a positive for the shoe, it also renders a negative - it's a dull ride. Whether you're an overpronator or a neutral runner in need of extra arch support, I can confirm that the Saucony Guide is neither obtrusive nor too harsh to not find that sweet spot in your daily running shoe roster.",
