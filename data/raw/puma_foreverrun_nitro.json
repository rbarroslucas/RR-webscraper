  "RR_verdict": "If you're looking to break from the mainstream, the PUMA ForeverRun Nitro could be your go-to stability daily trainer. We found that it combines responsive foam, fantastic traction, and superb stability—a trio that's hard to find, all enriched with unique features that set it apart from the competition. Nonetheless, we hold some concerns regarding the outsole's durability and tight forefoot. Moreover, the 10-mm drop might not appeal to every runner out there.",
