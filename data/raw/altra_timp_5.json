  "RR_verdict": "The Altra Timp 5 marks a significant leap forward, debuting a Vibram Megagrip outsole and achieving an impressive weight reduction from v4. At its heart, it maintains the zero-drop philosophy, and it's still great for daily trail runs, particularly on less demanding scenarios. In our tests, we noticed the ride leans toward the firm side, and for some minimalist enthusiasts, the Timp 5 probably lacks enough ground feel. Nevertheless, we think it's a stellar upgrade at a reasonable price point, providing a superb zero-drop choice for trail runners.",
