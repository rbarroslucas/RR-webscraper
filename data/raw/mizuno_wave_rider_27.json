  "total_score": "91",
  "pros": "Exceptionally reliable; Ideal for heel strikers; Plush cushioning for extended runs; Highly durable outsole; Reasonably priced at $140; Performs well in all weather conditions; Versatile across a range of speeds",
  "cons": "A bit on the heavier side; 13.2-mm drop may be a drawback for forefoot strikers",
  "RR_verdict": "The 27th edition of the Mizuno Wave Rider is back one more year in our lab, aiming to wow both its longtime fans like us and newcomers to the series. Its improved cushioning, responsiveness, and built-to-last outsole make it once again a dream for heel strikers. However, while it offers top-notch quality at a fair price, in our opinion, those who are forefoot strikers or are in search of an ultra-lightweight daily trainer might not find it to their liking.",
