  "cons": "A generally narrow fit; Heavier than the v39; Not a very memorable ride",
  "RR_verdict": "For years, the Pegasus has been pretty much synonymous with the term ‘daily trainer’. It’s a Nike icon that’s gotten countless runners—including us—through the highs and lows of their running journeys. In its 40th version, the shoe received an upper refresh—making it comfier and arguably giving it a better lockdown. Though its updates are somewhat anticlimactic for such a milestone edition, we believe that this Peg remains a trusty, reliable training partner for just about anyone.",
