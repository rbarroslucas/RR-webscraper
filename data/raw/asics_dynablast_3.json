  "total_score": "83",
  "pros": "Light and nimble; Budget-friendly; Nicely-cushioned landings; Responsive trampoline-like ride; Premium feeling comfort; Strong and grippy outsole; Performs consistently in the cold; Durable upper construction; Roomy toebox; Good lockdown; Comfy straight out of the box",
  "cons": "Lackluster breathability; Tongue slips to the side; Lace bite",
  "RR_verdict": "The ASICS Dynablast 3 maintains the comfortable and responsive ride we came to know and love about its predecessor. With even more cushy and responsive FF Blast foam in its rockered midsole, we couldn't get enough of taking this shoe out on the road. From shorter to longer runs and slower to faster training sessions, this neutral daily trainer coddled our feet with levels of comfort we normally expect with a much higher price tag. While it may be a little stuffy for warm days, its performance in our freezer tests makes it a worthy cool-weather companion.",
