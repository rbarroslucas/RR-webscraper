  "RR_verdict": "We are impressed with the ZoomX Invincible Run Flyknit 2 from Nike because it is a daily trainer where comfort is paramount. But what makes it better than most everyday running shoes, in our opinion, is the ton of bounce and support that it offers to gobble up the miles ahead. On top of this, the shoe provides us with a smooth and easy ride. Overall, the Nike ZoomX Invincible Run Flyknit 2 is a definite must-have for days when your legs are tired and if you want a fun, lively long run.",
