  "total_score": "77",
  "pros": "Wallet-friendly pricing; Enhanced midsole cushioning; Heel-striker optimized design; Spacious toebox; Closer than ever to the Peg Trail; Upgraded midsole; All-terrain versatility; Reflective elements",
  "cons": "Reduced stack height compared to v2; Not the best for forefoot strikers; Limited breathability",
  "RR_verdict": "From our angle, the Juniper Trail 3 offers excellent value for its price. We were impressed by Nike's thoughtful upgrades, including an improved midsole and enhanced weight, while keeping its spacious upper intact. This shoe shines as an affordable, door-to-trail option that doubles well for hiking or even daily wear, though we proved in the lab that it’s not ideal for hot weather or forefoot strikers.",
