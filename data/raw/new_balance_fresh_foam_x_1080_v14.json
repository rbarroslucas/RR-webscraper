  "brand": "New Balance",
  "total_score": "86",
  "pros": "Amazing step-in feel; Excellent durability; Cloud-soft midsole; Ideal for forefoot and midfoot strikers; Perfect for recovery runs; Airy upper; Fairly priced for a premium daily trainer; Stability improvements",
  "cons": "Noticeable weight increase; Tapered toebox limits toe splay; Midsole could be too soft for some",
  "RR_verdict": "New Balance set out to enhance stability in the Fresh Foam X 1080 v14, but in our tests, this came at the cost of noticeable weight gain—a step back from its predecessor. We also found the tapered toebox restrictive and less comfortable for walking. However, the shoe impressed us with its exceptional durability, highly breathable and premium upper, and increased stack height, making it an excellent choice for easy runs and recovery jogs.",
