  "brand": "New Balance",
  "total_score": "90",
  "pros": "Incredibly plush midsole; Effective rockered ride; Ideal for long-distance training; Significant weight reduction from the first version; Rare wide-size availability for a supershoe; Exceptionally durable outsole; Surprisingly stable performance; Compliant with World Athletics regulations",
  "cons": "The upper lacks breathability and durability; Energy return falls short compared to other supershoes; Noticeable discrepancy from the stated drop",
  "RR_verdict": "At $180, the New Balance FuelCell SuperComp Trainer v2 offers a great deal for a shoe that combines cloud-like FuelCell cushioning technology with a carbon fiber plate, culminating in a significant, race-day-legal 39.3-mm stack height. Despite being on the heavier side for a supershoe, we found in the lab that it's perfect for tempo workouts and long runs, and its roomy fit could appeal to marathon runners looking for ultimate comfort, even if it means a bit more weight on their feet.",
