  "total_score": "86",
  "pros": "Outstanding durability; More ZoomX cushioning than ever before; All-day comfort; Ideal for long-distance training; Top-notch material use; Can double as walking shoe; Truly a beefed-up Pegasus; Finally dips under 10 oz",
  "cons": "Could benefit from more ZoomX; Possible heel slippage",
  "RR_verdict": "The Vomero 17 marks a significant upgrade, shedding the Air unit for added ZoomX cushioning and slashing weight, firmly establishing itself as a premium Pegasus in Nike's lineup. We found it to be a steadfast companion that, while not standing out in any one area, consistently delivers in multiple distances and paces. We see potential for improvement in weight and fit, yet the overall durability and top-notch materials make it a solid recommendation especially for Nike enthusiasts.",
