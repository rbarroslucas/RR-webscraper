  "total_score": "87",
  "pros": "Triple-layer, spring-like midsole; Handles long runs and tempo efforts; Sublime step-in comfort; Incredibly fun to ride; Amazing build quality; Knit upper offers top breathability; Visually stunning from every angle; 360-degree reflectivity; Finally a max-cushioned Pegasus!",
  "cons": "Narrow fit excludes many runners; Needs to lose some weight; High price; It's noisy!",
  "RR_verdict": "We found the Pegasus Premium to be a wild ride packed with cutting-edge tech. On our runs, we were impressed by the triple-layer midsole, including the full-length Air Zoom unit that delivers trampoline-like bounce. However, we think that its bottom-heavy feel, tapered toebox, and steep price tag work against it too. Still, not every purchase is logical, and this shoe delivers a unique ride and a head-turning look few can match.",
