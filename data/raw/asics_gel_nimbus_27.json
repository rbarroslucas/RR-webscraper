  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Even more foam underfoot!; Premium-feel, breathable upper; Fantastic stability; Excels at long distance training; Improved toebox with extra wiggle room; Flexible knit tongue; True maximalist comfort for recovery runs; Amazing heel lockdown; Top-tier grip",
  "cons": "Feels bulky and heavy; Minor price increase",
  "RR_verdict": "ASICS revamped the Nimbus series with the 25th edition, and by the 27th, it’s all about refinement. In our lab tests, we found it remains a high-cushioned daily trainer made for comfort-focused runners. Its ultra-thick midsole provides a stable, shock-absorbing ride, but the bottom-heavy feel and firmer foam may not appeal to everyone. In our view, it’s still best suited for easy miles, lacking the versatility for varied paces. And while the price increase isn’t drastic, it might not sit well with regular Nimbus buyers.",
