  "pros": "Travel friendly!; Roomy, foot-shaped toebox; Breathable upper; Excellent stability; Great for midfoot and forefoot strikers; Fairly priced; Reliable for daily miles; Good option as a first Altra",
  "cons": "Needs a better foam; Not for long runs; Tongue should be gusseted; Not for zero-drop lovers",
  "RR_verdict": "In our experience, the Altra Experience Form provides a welcoming entry to Altra’s lineup with its approachable 4-mm drop—ideal for anyone still unsure about zero-drop shoes. We really liked the spacious toebox and stable ride, which offer all-day comfort and make it a fantastic choice for casual wear as well. However, the foam’s lack of bounce left the ride feeling flat on longer distances, which may be a drawback for some. Still, we think it remains a stable, dependable choice at a fair price.",
