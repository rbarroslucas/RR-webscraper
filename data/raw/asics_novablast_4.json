  "pros": "Enhanced outsole offering better grip and durability; Improved upper comfort with premium materials; Upgraded tongue padding; Exceptional value at just $140; More cushion than ever before; Accommodates a wide range of foot sizes; The most stable Novablast yet; Retains most of its fun and energetic ride",
  "cons": "Not the best for hot summer runs; Outsole still lacks grip in wet conditions; Minor weight increase compared to v3",
  "RR_verdict": "This is the eagerly awaited sequel to one of 2023's best-selling, top-rated neutral daily trainers. That's why we were expecting just a minor upgrade, but ASICS surprised us with significant changes. The Novablast 4 introduces a premium upper paired with extra cushioning, enhanced stability, and better grip. In our view, ASICS aimed to address the weaker points of v3 and largely succeeded, although the shoe did gain some weight and lose a bit of its original magic in the process. Despite this, it's a fantastic all-rounder we think it's poised to be one of the top running shoes for a second consecutive year.",
