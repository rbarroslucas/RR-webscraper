  "RR_verdict": "For $60, we think that the Adidas Galaxy 6 is a real steal—unless you're put off by its noticeable weight and lackluster breathability. But if you can roll with these, you're in for some premium perks: generous comfort in the upper, comfy cushioning, amazing stability, and a sleek look—all without breaking the bank. Oh, and we do believe that it's a stellar pick for those just starting their running journey!",
