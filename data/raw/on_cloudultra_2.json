  "RR_verdict": "The On Cloudultra 2 is the Swiss brand's second attempt at crafting a shoe that can devour miles on the trails. We were impressed by its build quality, the incredibly breathable upper, and the comfortable experience it delivers, not only in running but also in hiking and walking. However, at $180, we expected more cushioning, less weight, and better energy return from the shoe. In our experience, while the Cloudultra 2 has some standout features, it seems On still has some room for improvement.",
