  "RR_verdict": "The Rivera 4 is a moderately cushioned neutral daily trainer from Altra, the zero-drop specialists, that shines when it comes to versatility. This workhorse of a shoe never let us down whether we took it out for low-intensity jogs, speedy tempo sessions, long-distance efforts, or even pleasant strolls about town. There's so much we enjoyed about this shoe that brought the fun to our daily runs that we're willing to look past the subpar ventilation and other minor nitpicks we had while testing the Rivera 4.",
