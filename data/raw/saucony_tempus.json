  "RR_verdict": "We found the Tempus from Saucony to be an excellent stability running shoe for a variety of paces and distances. Whether we're running slow (just not recovery-day slow), picking up the pace, or running short or long miles, this shoe can handle it. Even more, it's not the type of support shoe that's reserved solely for overpronators (whose feet roll inward). The Saucony Tempus also welcomes neutral runners who want stable strides all the way.",
