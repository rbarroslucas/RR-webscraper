  "pros": "Snappy ride; Great for fast track workouts; Well ventilated; Amazing ground feel; Lighter than ever; The outsole lasts forever; Grippy Continental rubber; Modestly priced",
  "cons": "Not for cold weather; Heel slippage; Needs more Lightstrike Pro; Ride is too firm",
  "RR_verdict": "The Adizero Adios from Adidas is a no-fuss traditional racing flat that remains that way in its 7th iteration. Its low-stack firm ride took us back to the good ol' days before the dominance of super shoes. Only this time around, we noticed in the lab that it comes with a chunk of ultra-reactive, bouncy Lightstrike Pro foam located in the forefoot.",
