  "brand": "Brooks",
  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Enhanced, maxed-out protection; Excellent grip on dry surfaces; Remarkably stable despite its massive height; Ideal for heel strikers; Perfect for road-to-trail transitions; Ultra-comfortable for long runs with DNA Loft v3; Lighter compared to the Caldera 5; Superb heel support; Extensive upper TPU protection",
  "cons": "Still too heavy; Excessively wide platform for technical terrain; Too much exposed foam on the outsole",
  "RR_verdict": "The Caldera 6 from Brooks stands out as a heavyweight champion in the trail running shoe category, embodying both comfort and protection. Ideal for long trail runs and equally impressive for road-to-trail training sessions, it’s a top pick in versatility. Enhanced with DNA Loft v3 foam, the shoe is now lighter and plushier than before, boosting its overall appeal. However, its XXL dimensions contribute to some additional weight, and because of its size, it's not the most agile for sharp turns or rapid descents.",
  "awards": "Top pick in best ultra running shoes (2024), Top pick in best Brooks trail running shoes (2024)",
