  "brand": "Saucony",
  "total_score": "89",
  "pros": "Incredible value at only $100; Significant weight reduction from version 2; Impressively cushioned with PWRRUN foam; Fantastic durability; Suitable for quicker paces; Excellent as a daily workhorse; Lovely upper; Works for short and long runs",
  "cons": "Probably too stiff for very relaxed runs; Slightly narrower forefoot than before",
  "RR_verdict": "In our view, the Saucony Axon 3 truly defines \"value\" in the running shoe world. Priced at just $100, this latest iteration significantly improves upon the Axon 2 with better cushioning, reduced weight, an enhanced fit, and a more durable outsole. We think it serves a wide range of runners brilliantly, from beginners seeking their first versatile shoe to high-mileage runners looking for a dependable daily workhorse. The minor issues we found in the lab, like a bit of excessive stiffness and a narrower forefoot, hardly detract from what is an all-around exceptional shoe.",
