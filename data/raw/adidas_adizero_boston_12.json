  "total_score": "89",
  "pros": "Lightstrike 2.0 brings a remarkable upgrade; Delivers a fun ride; Lighter than versions 10 and 11; Handles both slow and fast paces with ease; Wide toebox; Durable and grippy Continental outsole; Even more Lightstrike Pro superfoam; Improved stability due to a broader base; Fantastic for midfoot-to-forefoot strikers",
  "cons": "Upper durability falls short; Tongue and heel could benefit from extra padding; Heel strikers might prefer v11",
  "RR_verdict": "In our opinion, the Boston 12 marks a welcomed return to the shoe's roots, evolving as a light, versatile, and universally appealing running partner. It's once again designed to handle a range of runs, from moderate recovery sessions to tempo intervals. The updated Lightstrike 2.0 foam boosts bounce and softness, complementing the brilliant Lightstrike Pro. In our tests, we believe that this iteration makes a significant leap from its predecessor, showcasing smoother transitions, a more comfortable ride, and a lighter build.",
