  "total_score": "90",
  "pros": "Maximalist cushioning; Convertible heel for dual-purpose wear; Machine-washable for easy maintenance; Lightning-fast BOA lacing system; Fantastic toebox durability; Fairly priced for having BOA; Ideal for cold weather; Unique aesthetics; Stable heel",
  "cons": "Heavier than a brick; Not for serious running; Outsole wears down fast; Narrow toebox",
  "RR_verdict": "While Under Armour labels the SlipSpeed Mega as a running shoe, we think it’s better described as a jogging-ready sneaker. In our lab tests, we found that it lacks the speed, responsiveness, and breathability needed for serious training. We loved the BOA lacing system for its lightning-fast lockdown, and the slip-on convertible heel makes it a unique option on the market. While it won’t win any races, we think its bold aesthetics and distinctive features make it one of the most polarizing shoes we've tested.",
