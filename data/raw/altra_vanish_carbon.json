  "total_score": "83",
  "pros": "Runs fast; Smooth heel-to-toe transitions; Lots of protective foam underfoot; Feels responsive; Propulsive toe rocker; Relatively lightweight; Stable during sharp turns; Lockdown fit; Roomy toe box; Accommodates wide feet; Breathable on hot days",
  "cons": "Expensive; Outsole is extremely flimsy; Could be lighter for a super shoe; Somewhat firm cushioning; Laces don't stay tied",
  "RR_verdict": "For their first foray into the realm of carbon-plated super shoes, we're impressed with how much Altra got right with the Vanish Carbon. The shoe's half plate and supercritical Ego Pro midsole foam work in tandem to propel us forward, bringing efficiency to our strides, while the incredibly grippy outsole keeps us feeling surefooted even when cornering at high speeds. The biggest surprise we discovered while testing the shoe, however, is its misleading drop height which will have zero-drop absolutists shaking their fists in bewilderment. It's also quite pricey, especially for a shoe that we'd reserve for race days due to the questionable durability of the EVA outsole.",
