  "RR_verdict": "The Brooks Caldera is back and better, keeping its star features—tons of cushioning, a ventilated upper, and a stable ride—perfect for easy trails. We were impressed again by its plush and responsive performance during our evaluations. Still, it falls short for technical terrains and could benefit from a lighter design. Based on our tests, the Caldera truly stands out for runners who prioritize a plush ride on the trails.",
