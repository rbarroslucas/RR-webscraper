  "total_score": "89",
  "pros": "Still lightweight!; Premium materials; Premium-quality materials; Better than predecessor at long runs; Great for daily wear or gym workouts; Durable outsole; Still lightweight; Enhanced rockered shape; Nice reflective elements",
  "cons": "Price tag exceeds performance value; Not for faster paces; Lacks a gusseted tongue; Firm foam doesn't feel like clouds at all",
  "RR_verdict": "The On Cloudsurfer 2 delivers a comfort-driven, durability-rich ride with premium materials, and we enjoyed its versatility for both running and casual wear. However, in our experience, it lacks the responsiveness we expect from a high-priced daily trainer. While we think loyal On fans will enjoy its familiar feel and smooth ride, we believe there are better-performing, more budget-friendly options available.",
