  "cons": "Overly padded tongue; Thick ankle collar; Runs warm; Feels a touch long",
  "RR_verdict": "I am delighted that ASICS' long-running, budget stability shoe gets updated and finally moves away from the plastic post design. This shoe is something that I find ideal for runners looking to get into the sport who pronate or have flat feet and want a product that’s more comfortable, consistent, and lighter on the wallet than competing shoes.",
