  "brand": "Adidas",
  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Amazing Strung upper; Impressive durability; Rule-breaker cushioning; Integrated dual carbon plates; Exceptional Continental outsole; Wonderful for long distance training; Stability exceeds expectations; Superior build quality; Screams innovation",
  "cons": "Simply too heavy; Exorbitantly priced at $300; Less exhilarating than v1",
  "RR_verdict": "The Prime X 2 Strung is the pinnacle of Adidas's technological innovation, setting a new standard in engineering for running shoes. In our lab examination, we discovered that this shoe integrates a colossal stack height and dual carbon plates, complemented by a quartet of distinct foams and a durable, exceptionally breathable Strung upper. And one of the finest outsoles we've ever put to the test. However, we think its weight makes it less than ideal for racing, positioning it as a $300 supertrainer that almost reached legendary status.",
