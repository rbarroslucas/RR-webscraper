  "cons": "Pricey; No wide widths",
  "RR_verdict": "The Kayano Lite series successfully continues to re-think the concept of stability running shoes in its third iteration. We believe that the shoe managed to create a supportive platform for runners with flat feet and overpronation in a lightweight, streamlined, and non-intrusive package. So much so that even testers with neutral pronation among us can feel comfortable wearing the shoe.",
