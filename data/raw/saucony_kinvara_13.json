  "RR_verdict": "The Saucony Kinvara 13 doesn't just look fast; it also runs fast. Apart from being the lightest Saucony Kinvara, it's also the brand's lively and natural-feeling jack-of-all-trades. We established on our tests that this tempo trainer is cushioned enough for short to mid-distance runs, and is bouncy yet stable for faster paces. For Saucony fans, we can say that the Kinvara 13 is a low-to-the-ground complement to the famous Saucony Endorphin Speed 2.",
