  "total_score": "91",
  "pros": "Most cushioned On model to date; New CloudTec Phase technology enhances speed; Improved upper with better durability and breathability; Extremely long-lasting outsole and upper; Effective heel lock; Good stability considering its stack height; Comfortably smooth ride; Excellent lockdown for regular-width feet",
  "cons": "Helion foam lacks energy return; Seems overpriced, like other On models; Actual drop significantly varies from the stated measurement",
  "RR_verdict": "We think the On Cloudeclipse is a commendable response from On to the fierce competition in the maximalist daily trainer segment. We were really impressed with its high-quality build, unique ride, and protective stack height. However, it does come up short in aspects like energy return and overall value. Indeed, with a price tag of $180, it might not be the go-to option for those open to any brand; but for loyal fans of On, especially those focusing on easy or long runs, it's a perfect addition to their rotation. In summary, we found it to be a great shoe that delivers in many areas, yet it still lacks that extra spark we've seen in some competitors.",
