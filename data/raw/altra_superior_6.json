  "RR_verdict": "The Superior 6 from Altra belongs to their line of zero-drop, low-stack trail shoes. We were excited to see it maintain its commitment to a grounded feel, offering stability and agility on various surfaces and inclines. However, we noticed in our lab tests that it sheds the optional StoneGuard insert found in its predecessors. We also found it slightly heavy for its stack height and the ride might be too firm for some. Yet, it stands out as a great choice for trail enthusiasts wanting a natural running experience without breaking the bank.",
