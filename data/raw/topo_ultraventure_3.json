  "total_score": "87",
  "pros": "Ultra-roomy toe box; Protective underfoot; Works for hiking too; Excellent traction by Vibram; Great midfoot and heel hold; Versatile for trails and roads; Above-average durability; Lightweight for its size; Solid Altra Olympus alternative",
  "cons": "Not the best for heel strikers; Only for easy or mild trails; Needs better outsole coverage; Lacks reflective elements",
  "RR_verdict": "The Ultraventure 3 provides all-day cushioning, making it an excellent choice for long-distance training. We were impressed by its ultra-spacious toebox, which offers exceptional comfort for wide-footed runners, and its grippy-yet-durable Vibram outsole. Despite its maximalist cushioning, we found that it maintains a reasonable weight and impressive flexibility, making it a great option for hiking as well. However, we think it’s not the best fit for heel strikers due to its geometry, and runners with narrow feet may find it excessively roomy.",
