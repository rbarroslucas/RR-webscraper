  "RR_verdict": "The Rivera 3 delivers a velvety-smooth ride that exemplifies what we want from a daily trainer. From the super comfy and plush midsole to the generously padded and roomy interior, these neutral runners from Altra kept us happy for miles on end during testing. With only a few minor nitpicks to gripe about, they're a great introduction to the zero-drop experience.",
