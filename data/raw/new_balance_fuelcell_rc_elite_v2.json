  "pros": "Plush comfort in a race shoe; Smooth, fast ride; Breathable; Responsive toe-off; Carbon plated; Stiff but not overly stiff; True to size; Stretchy material hugs feet; Sticky, grippy tread; Sexy! Sparkles in sunlight",
  "cons": "Spendy at $225; Heavier than other race shoes; Tongue tends to fold under",
  "RR_verdict": "Looking for a luxurious spa-day treat for the feet? The New Balance FuelCell RC Elite v2 will do the job! I felt that it's got an uber-plush midsole but it also has a plate that balances it out, making the ride not only cushy but also very snappy and stable. If you're looking for a mid to long-distance racing shoe that will outthrow the Swoosh, this, along with the MetaSpeed Sky, is my best bet!",
