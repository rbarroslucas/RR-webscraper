  "brand": "New Balance",
  "total_score": "79",
  "pros": "Exceptionally plush FuelCell midsole; Highly breathable upper; Stability-focused TPU plate; Ideal for midfoot strikers; Suitable for daily wear too; Works for tempo training; More affordable than similar models; Keeps losing weight",
  "cons": "Poor durability; Limited energy return; Not the best for heel strikers; Outsole prone to trapping small rocks",
  "RR_verdict": "The New Balance FuelCell Propel v5 shines in its price category, offering top-notch versatility across various distances and paces. We found that its plush cushioning significantly enhances comfort, distinguishing it from most rivals in its category. However, we noticed issues with durability and energy return, and the shoe's drop combined with its mushy foam renders it suboptimal for heel strikers. Despite these drawbacks, we discovered it's hard to find another option on the market that delivers similar performance and fun at such an attractive price point.",
