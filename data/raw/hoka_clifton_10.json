  "brand": "HOKA",
  "total_score": "86",
  "pros": "Superb joint protection; Wider toebox improves toe splay; Comfortable upper; Stable ride despite its high stack height; Works well for heel strikers; Ideal for long runs; Versatile for daily walking or jogging; Achilles-friendly heel collar design; Traction improvements",
  "cons": "Needs a better foam ASAP; Notable weight gain from v9; Feels more Bondi than Clifton; Non-gusseted tongue",
  "RR_verdict": "The Hoka Clifton 10 took nearly two and a half years to arrive—a long stretch compared to the yearly cycles of some competitors. Yet despite its familiar looks, we discovered a full overhaul under the hood. Hoka raised the stack to maximalist levels, widened the toebox, and increased the drop to favor heel strikers. There are downsides too, as the weight gain, outdated foam, and flatter ride make it less lively than before. Still, for comfort-seekers chasing a stable, everyday option, it remains a solid pick that’s likely to sell fast once again.",
