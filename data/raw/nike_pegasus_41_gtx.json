  "pros": "Waterproof Gore-Tex membrane; Dual Air Zoom units; Improved tongue padding; Durable yet comfy upper; Rugged toe bumper; ReactX bouncy foam; Keeps feet warm; Reliable grip on wet surfaces; Amazing for heel strikers",
  "cons": "Tapered toebox; Heavy; Outsole durability concerns; Maybe a bit pricey",
  "RR_verdict": "The Nike Pegasus 41 GTX delivers real waterproof protection to the iconic daily trainer but comes with a few compromises. We found this Gore-Tex version noticeably heavier at 11.1 oz, $20 pricier, and underperforming on dry roads. However, its exceptional behavior on wet surfaces impressed us—offering excellent grip and enhanced comfort through a well-padded, weather-resistant upper. The ReactX foam and dual Air Zoom units retain the cushioned, responsive feel of the original Peg, making this a solid winter-specific option.",
