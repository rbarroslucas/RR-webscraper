  "RR_verdict": "Plush comfort in a Salomon! The Ultra Glide is the answer to Hoka’s reign over the cushioned trail shoe category and it is great. This shoe has a peppy, energetic ride, a soft, breathable upper, and a grippy, durable outsole. It’s worth a look at $140 and has a ton of great features. The only gripe I could conjure up is it’s a touch narrow if you have a wide foot.",
