  "brand": "Altra",
  "total_score": "85",
  "pros": "Comfortable and premium-feeling upper; Roomy, unmistakably-Altra fit; Secure lockdown even for narrow feet; Smooth and responsive ride; Good for any distance at an easy pace; Effective, but not obtrusive, rocker; Copious amount of padding; Breathable; Absorbs impact well",
  "cons": "Cushioning on the firm side, but a toss-up on how firm; Doesn’t feel like a zero-drop shoe; Substantial break-in period; On the heavier side",
  "RR_verdict": "The Altra VIA Olympus is the max-cushioned road runner that we have been waiting for. Though it managed to rain on its own parade with a firmer-than-expected midsole, we found that this shoe more than made up for it with a comfy upper, stable platform, smooth ride, and wide fit.",
