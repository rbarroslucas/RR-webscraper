  "RR_verdict": "We found that the Nike Downshifter 12 is a budget running shoe that serves very well as a sneaker too. The shoe's price is one of the lowest on the market and is definitely the most appealing reason to consider it. Yet, that’s not its only pro, we also loved its surprisingly enjoyable midsole and overall in-shoe comfort. And given the fact that it’s made from 20% recycled content, we probably can’t ask for more.",
