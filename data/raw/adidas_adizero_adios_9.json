  "brand": "Adidas",
  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Full Lightstrike Pro superfoam; Incredibly lightweight and fun; Great for tempo sessions; Works as a plateless 5K/10K racer; Durable, grippy outsole; Excellent value; Ideal for track workouts",
  "cons": "Not stable at all; Tapered toebox; Not ideal for heel strikers; Upper lacks airflow",
  "RR_verdict": "The Adidas Adizero Adios 9 is a bold revamp that channels the spirit of old-school racing flats while borrowing supershoe-grade elements from the Adios Pro 4—same upper, same foam, same outsole. What sets it apart from its cousin is the much lower stack height, the absence of a carbon plate, and a more affordable price. We loved that it offers an exciting ride, yet falls short in terms of stability and long-distance versatility.",
