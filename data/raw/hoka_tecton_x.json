  "pros": "2 carbon plates: very propulsive ride; Insanely stable; Looks fast and runs fast; Lightweight; Very cushioned & responsive; Worth the investment; Room for feet swelling; Grippy; No break-in; Vegan materials used",
  "cons": "Not for technical terrains; Might accumulate mud; Expensive",
  "RR_verdict": "The Hoka Tecton X is Hoka's first carbon-plated trail running shoe. To justify the name, it just might have started a tectonic shift - that's how much we admire it. It's positioned as a speed-ready, racing and training companion to the Hoka Speedgoat 5. Thanks to the dual-plated design, we found that it shines at fast paces, especially the ultra ones. On top of this, it's a max-cushioned running shoe that keeps our feet protected without weighing them down.",
