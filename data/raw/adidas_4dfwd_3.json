  "RR_verdict": "The third iteration of the Adidas 4DFWD continues to amaze us. Not just with its head-turning aesthetic charm that hooks us in, but with its soft yet vibrant touch that keeps us coming back for more. The shoe's cushy and ride courtesy of its 3D-printed 4D midsole has a nice little spring to it that brings the fun to our daily runs. With the Continental rubber on the outsole providing excellent traction to boot, the 4DFWD 3 makes a lot of good arguments to justify its price. While this creature of comfort could use a bit of a diet, it serves us well as a companion for our low-intensity runs and walks about town.",
