  "total_score": "90",
  "pros": "Finally a real supershoe from Brooks; Exceptionally breathable upper; PEBA-based DNA Gold foam; Top-notch durability for a race shoe; Awesome from 5K to the marathon distance; Rocker promotes smooth toe-offs; High drop suits heel strikers; Keeps same price as non-PEBA model; Propulsion-boosting Speedvault+ plate",
  "cons": "Not ideal for forefoot strikers; Narrow, tapered toebox; Too unstable for some; Could be lighter",
  "RR_verdict": "The Hyperion Elite 4 PB finally delivers the performance that the original model lacked. We found that the new DNA Gold foam finally it's on par with other supershoes, leaving all Brooks loyal fans without feeling that they need to betray and go to other brands. And luckily, it retains all the good features of its predecessor, making it a worthy contender in the racing category, though we still think it lies one step below the top supershoes.",
