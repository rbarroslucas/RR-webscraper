  "brand": "Mizuno",
  "total_score": "91",
  "pros": "Enerzy NXT foam in the heel; Versatile for daily miles; Secure lockdown; Stability-focused Wave plate; Nice room for toe splay; Amazing for high-volume feet; Ideal for heel strikers; Great for dirt roads",
  "cons": "Sky-high drop; Outsole durability could be better; Lacks the energetic pop of some rivals; Narrow heel",
  "RR_verdict": "The Wave Rider 28 sticks to its well-established identity while introducing subtle refinements. We found that Mizuno added a small dose of Enerzy NXT foam in the heel, slightly improving cushioning without drastically altering the ride. The fit remains consistent with past versions but now provides a bit more room up front. However, the shoe still feels somewhat firm underfoot and features one of the steepest drops we’ve measured, making it far from ideal for midfoot and forefoot strikers.",
