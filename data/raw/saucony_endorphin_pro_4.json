  "pros": "Durable upper and outsole; Spacious upper fit; Enhanced midsole comfort; Great value at $225 for a supershoe; Versatile across all paces; Ideal for heel strikers; More stable than ever",
  "cons": "Slightly heavier than v3; Less suited for forefoot strikers; Competitors may feel quicker",
  "RR_verdict": "In racing, the Saucony Endorphin Pro 4 performs admirably, but its real highlight is the extraordinary comfort it provides as a supershoe. It shifts focus from pure performance to a more relaxed, spacious feel. We were impressed by its ability to cater to heel strikers with exceptional durability, making it an excellent choice for mid-to-back pack marathoners. And for us, it's not just a race-day shoe—it excels in long-distance training too. However, the increased weight and more conservative geometry might not appeal to those aiming for peak performance.",
