  "RR_verdict": "The Speedgoat 5 from Hoka remains your reliable and great-value do-everything trail shoe. But if you want to bring the best out of it, take the shoe to a fast run on very technical terrain. On top of this, it ticks all the boxes of an excellent trail shoe. We found this Hoka shoe insanely grippy, durable, and supportive; conquering the great outdoors is an easy feat. Overall, we vouch for the Hoka Speedgoat 5 if you want to go fast and far.",
