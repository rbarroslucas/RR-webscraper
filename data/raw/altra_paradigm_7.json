  "total_score": "82",
  "pros": "Exceptional space for toe splay; Highly stable and supportive; Really light; Features Ego Max foam for added comfort; Innerflex technology promotes natural midfoot striking; Outstanding durability; Versatile for walking or gym use; Genuine zero-drop design!",
  "cons": "Becomes uncomfortably firm and stiff in cold weather; Priced on the higher end of the spectrum at $170; Not suitable for fast-paced running",
  "RR_verdict": "The Altra Paradigm 7 shines as a zero-drop daily trainer, appealing to both neutral runners and those with mild pronation. Its standout feature, the abundant Ego Max cushioning, ensures a perfect balance of responsive and cushioned ride. While the foot-shaped upper allows for amazing toe splay for everyone, we found the added stability makes this model particularly welcoming for newcomers to the Altra brand. However, the shoe comes at a higher price point and is not optimized for tempo training.",
