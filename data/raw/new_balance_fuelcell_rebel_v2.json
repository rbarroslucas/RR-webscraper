  "RR_verdict": "I found it challenging to find a flaw in the Rebel v2 from New Balance! The usual case is that all-rounders are good at everything and great at nothing. But this shoe literally REBELS against that! It excels at everything I pace it through - it's plush for easy recovery days and long runs, but exceptionally bouncy and peppy when I pick up the pace in tempo sessions!",
