  "cons": "Sloppy fit; Lacks support on turns",
  "RR_verdict": "The absolute highlight of the Arahi 5 is its SUPER plush cushioning. It's a max-cushioned trainer that I think is perfect for recovery days and the long haul on the road. Even better, it is the embodiment of \"looks can be deceiving\" - it's big and clunky, but truly, it disappears on foot!",
