  "brand": "Brooks",
  "total_score": "85",
  "pros": "Stack height upgrade!; Reliable support; Breathable mesh with oversized vents; Price remains unchanged; Available in 4 width options; Good durability; Plush tongue for top comfort; Ideal for heel strikers; Foam upgrade to DNA Loft v3",
  "cons": "Firmer-than-expected midsole; High drop may feel too steep; Toebox height is a bit low; Non-gusseted tongue",
  "RR_verdict": "The Brooks Adrenaline GTS 24 remains one of the easiest recommendations for heel strikers needing stability, and after testing it, we’re convinced it’s more refined than ever. It keeps its reputation as an ultra-reliable trainer while introducing key upgrades like the DNA Loft v3 midsole, which offers a firmer yet more responsive feel. We found that the revamped upper strikes a great balance between comfort and breathability, making it a fantastic choice for daily miles. However, the firmer foam and steep drop won’t suit everyone, but for most runners with stability needs, it’s a no-brainer.",
