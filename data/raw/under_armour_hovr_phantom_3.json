  "cons": "Excessively heavy; Not suitable for long-distance running; Lacks breathability",
  "RR_verdict": "The Under Armour HOVR Phantom 3 does a great job in the multidisciplinary category, adept at both running and gym sessions, even pairing well with your go-to jeans. In our lab tests, we appreciated its versatility but noted a few drawbacks. We found the energy return insufficient for our liking, and at almost 12 oz, it felt overly heavy for our runs. Additionally, during summer workouts, we were concerned about its breathability—it simply felt too warm even indoors. Despite these issues, it could still be a solid choice for cooler climates and low-mileage runners.",
