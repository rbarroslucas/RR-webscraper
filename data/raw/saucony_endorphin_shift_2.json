  "RR_verdict": "Looking to build a perfect 3-shoe running lineup? Look no further! The Saucony Endorphin line has it all, the race-ready Pro, the tempo-day Speed, and the daily trainer in this, the Endorphin Shift 2. I found that it’s built around a rockered design. With a tall stack and stiff midsole, it effortlessly rolls through my stride giving my legs time to recover from my faster-paced workouts. The upper is highly breathable too!",
