  "pros": "Pleasantly lightweight; Versatile enough for tempo session, long runs, or easy days; Responsive and energetic midsole; Good impact protection; Flexible and comfortable ride; Very breathable; Feels stable underfoot; Solid midfoot lockdown; No lace bite; Great traction over various surfaces; Suitable for wide feet; Can go sockless",
  "cons": "Not ideal for heel strikers; Outsole could be more durable; Upper feels snug despite being wide",
  "RR_verdict": "The Altra Torin 7 is a zero drop daily trainer that can tackle pretty much whatever challenge we throw at it. The midsole is energetic enough to pick up the pace for tempo sessions with ease while also being well cushioned and protective enough to keep us going during longer efforts. It’s also pleasantly padded, lightweight and breathable to boot, making the Torin 7 a comfy yet reliable workhorse of a shoe that bridges the gap between barfoot minimalism and max-cushioned comfort.",
