  "total_score": "86",
  "pros": "Well-cushioned for short to medium-distance runs; Smooth transitions; Flexible and easy on the foot; Feels stable underfoot; Performs consistently in the cold; Breathable for warm days; Durable, well-constructed upper; Generously padded heel counter; Secure lockdown; Budget-friendly; Suitable for walks and gym days; Great for beginner runners",
  "cons": "Not ideal for tempo training or long distances; Ride feels dull; Lacks arch support; Higher than advertised drop; Lacks traction on wet surfaces",
  "RR_verdict": "We commend the tenth iteration of ASICS' budget line of daily trainers, the Gel Excite 10 because it features a much more durable upper than its predecessor, and it’s worth every penny of its mind-bendingly low price tag. After testing the shoe, we found that Gel Excite 10 solidifies its reputation as a comfy and forgiving shoe that’s perfect for beginners and casual runners. Despite being more geared towards easier, low-intensity runs, it’s versatile enough to tackle most fitness activities, gym days, and long walks around town.",
