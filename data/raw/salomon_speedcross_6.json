  "pros": "Superior traction on wet, technical trails; Ideal for heel strikers; Impressive durability; Quick mud shedding ability; Lightest Speedcross yet; Secure lockdown with QuickLace system; Enhanced ground feel in the forefoot; Agile and responsive in fast corners",
  "cons": "Midsole feels like concrete; Extremely poor breathability; Not suitable for midfoot and forefoot strikers",
  "RR_verdict": "Since its debut in 2006, the Speedcross has become a trail-running staple for Salomon, almost reaching legendary status. In our lab, we found the sixth version to be lighter yet still rugged and durable, making it perfect for our fast-paced training and racing on challenging, early-season trails. Equipped with big lugs and a robust, closed upper, it also excels in muddy conditions. However, we found the shoe's extremely limited breathability makes it primarily suitable for cooler weather, and less ideal for warm or humid conditions.",
