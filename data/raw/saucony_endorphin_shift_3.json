  "RR_verdict": "In its 3rd iteration, we noticed that the Saucony Endorphin Shift loses a bit of speed but gains much more in comfort and protection. It’s a great daily performance trainer that’s able to shine on both easy days and when you need to push harder. Sure, it’s massive, but it's also surprisingly light on foot, stable, and versatile. We struggled to find any serious cons in this shoe.",
