  "pros": "Plush FF Blast+ cushioning; Airy mesh upper; Fantastic for ultra distances; Spacious, comfy and durable upper; Enhanced grip; Can handle some road running; Hiking-friendly; Fairly priced at $150",
  "cons": "Not winter-friendly; Too high for technical trails; Lacks ground feel",
  "RR_verdict": "In response to the demand for beefier trail shoes, ASICS presents the Trabuco Max 2, and we're really impressed. Floating on a big chunk of FF Blast+ foam, this shoe promises supreme comfort without sacrificing durability. The well-ventilated upper adds to its appeal, making it a go-to for long-distance runs in the heat. Even though it's on the heavier side and might not fit those with narrow feet, our experience shows it shines in terms of cushioning and comfort. Both in the lab and out on the trails, it emerged as a favorite for runners who value comfort above all else, supported by its fair price point and reliable stability.",
