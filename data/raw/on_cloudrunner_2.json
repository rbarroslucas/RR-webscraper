  "RR_verdict": "The Cloudrunner 2 from On marks a positive upgrade over its predecessor. We found in the lab that this mild stability shoe retains the exceptional build quality, breathability, and versatility of the first generation while introducing significant improvements like a lighter weight, increased flexibility, and a slightly-softer, bouncier Helion midsole. Despite these enhancements, the ride is still somewhat firm, and we believe the outsole requires a durability upgrade.",
