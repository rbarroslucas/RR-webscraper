  "cons": "Midsole is firm and provides low energy return; Outsole shows limited durability; Not suitable for forefoot strikers",
  "RR_verdict": "The Adidas Supernova 3 is a value-oriented daily trainer that nails quite a few things. We found in the lab that it's a stable choice, clearly designed for heel strikers, coupled with a well-ventilated engineered mesh and a spacious upper that easily accommodates wide feet. On the flip side, it might not win over advanced runners due to its limited energy return and relatively high heel-to-toe drop. We also observed that the outsole's durability leaves room for improvement, which is an important factor for those who typically wear down shoes quickly.",
