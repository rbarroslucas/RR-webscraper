  "brand": "Salomon",
  "total_score": "85",
  "pros": "Excellent grip on diverse terrains like mud or snow; Versatile for walking, hiking, and running; Secure and comfortable fit with QuickLace system; Compatible with custom insoles or OTC orthotics; Tailored for heel strikers; Brilliant on steep inclines due to effective lug design; Nice durability",
  "cons": "Insufficient cushioning in the forefoot; Stability issues in the heel area due to narrow design; Potentially uncomfortable high drop",
  "RR_verdict": "In our lab tests, the Salomon Supercross 4 stood out with its unique design, featuring an enormous 15.2-mm heel-to-toe drop and a narrow heel, tailored for speed in cornering but lacking in forefoot cushioning and stability. We were impressed by its exceptional durability and grip on challenging terrains, yet its heavy weight seemed at odds with the agility suggested by its design. Despite this, we believe it's a good choice for heel strikers seeking a versatile trail shoe capable of handling both hiking and running in the mountains.",
