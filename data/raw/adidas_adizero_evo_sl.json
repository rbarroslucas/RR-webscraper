  "RR_verdict": "We really believe that the Adidas Adizero EVO SL has the potential to transform the running shoe industry. Priced like a daily trainer, it features a 100% Lightstrike Pro midsole and world-class Continental outsole. On top of that, we found it lightweight, well-cushioned, sleek-looking and excellent for a wide range of paces and distances. While the short tongue and horrible laces left room for improvement, the EVO SL delivers a hard-to-believe mix of value, versatility and performance.",
