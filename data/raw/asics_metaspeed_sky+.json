  "RR_verdict": "Soar through the skies with the Metaspeed Sky+ from ASICS. We were drawn to this marathon racer as it's filled with all the responsiveness and pop we need to reach that finish line fast. And if you're looking for something light, this IS light. Even more, it's the perfect pair for race day. We also love that you can lace it up for faster training sessions.",
