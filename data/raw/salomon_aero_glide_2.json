  "total_score": "93",
  "pros": "360-degree reflectivity; Lightweight for its size; Enhanced upper; Superbly stable; Ideal for heel strikers; Well-protected outsole; Masters daily mileage with ease; Great for winter too!",
  "cons": "Excessively rigid; Still lacks a gusseted tongue; Lower-than-expected stack height",
  "RR_verdict": "The Salomon Aero Glide 2 excels as a no-frills option—comfortable, stable, and well-crafted, ticking all the boxes for a dependable daily trainer that delivers consistent performance throughout the year. We were impressed by its high-quality upper and grippy outsole, ensuring many miles of reliable running. However, we found that it's a bit rigid torsionally, and the cushioning doesn’t quite match the energy return and fun ride of its similarly-priced competitors.",
