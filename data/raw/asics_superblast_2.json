  "RR_verdict": "If budget isn't a barrier, we're confident in declaring the ASICS Superblast 2 the ultimate training shoe, and we think it even doubles as an exceptional racer for most. With a world-class midsole, a significantly improved upper, a more effective outsole, and all the cherished features of its predecessor preserved, this shoe excels in speed, cushioning, and versatility. And although it's not the most accommodating for wider feet and has seen a minor increase in weight, we believe that ASICS has surpassed expectations with this update, delivering an exceptional running shoe.",
