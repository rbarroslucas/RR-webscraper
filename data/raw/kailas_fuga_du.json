  "total_score": "85",
  "pros": "Very well cushioned; Phenomenal traction; Surprisingly light for its kind; Stability is off the charts; Rocker helps on long distances and uphills; Highly protective toebox; Secure lockdown; Convenient lacing; Efficient gaiter holder; Decent breathability",
  "cons": "Pricier than similar shoes; Not for wide feet",
  "RR_verdict": "A max-cushioned beast from Kailas, we witness how the Fuga DU is most in its element on technical and unforgiving trails. We found this shoe perfect for routes involving lots of ups and downs which is reflected in its name - DU stands for \"downhill and uphill.\" It comes with a mind-blowing cushioning-to-weight ratio as well as a mighty stable platform. What's the catch? Price. But if you have the budget, we are sure that you won't regret this investment.",
