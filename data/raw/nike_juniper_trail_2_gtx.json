  "RR_verdict": "We found the Nike Juniper Trail 2 GTX to excel as a versatile, door-to-trail waterproof option—perfect for both newcomers and seasoned trail enthusiasts. Despite its firm midsole, this model still impresses with a spacious toebox, rugged upper, and seamless road-to-trail adaptability. However, the notable price jump ($45) from its non-GTX counterpart and the lackluster energy return might not appeal to everyone.",
