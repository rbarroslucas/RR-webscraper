  "brand": "Nike",
  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Remarkably lightweight despite its broad size; Best-in-class breathability; Excels in the marathon distance; Repositioned Air Pods offer a better ride than the v2; ZoomX foam delivers massive energy return; Aids in forward momentum, especially when legs begin to fatigue; Better than ever for 5K/10K racing; Finally smooth transitions!",
  "cons": "Heel strikers might wear down the outsole quickly; The arch could still be a challenge for some; The sock-like tongue might not suit everyone",
  "RR_verdict": "In our view, the Alphafly 3 elevates the concept of a marathon supershoe, blending the best elements of previous models with groundbreaking enhancements. In our lab, we discovered that the synergy of the ultra-responsive foam, carbon-fiber plate, and Air Pods delivers unparalleled energy return. The debut of a new upper and a long-awaited continuous midsole also amazed us. And despite its steep $285 price tag, the enhanced arch fit convinces us it's an excellent choice for those chasing peak performance.",
