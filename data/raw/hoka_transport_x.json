  "cons": "Prohibitively expensive at $200; Unnecessary carbon plate; Durability concerns",
  "RR_verdict": "The Hoka Transport X leaves us scratching our heads in the lab. It's equipped with a carbon plate and a razor-thin upper, characteristics usually found in racing shoes. Yet, it's marketed as a versatile option for running, gym workouts, and even commuting. It's abundantly cushioned and performs well overall, but we just can't give it our stamp of approval as a running shoe. And at a $200 price point, we found it hard to justify the expense for what it offers and its limited durability.",
