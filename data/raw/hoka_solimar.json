  "total_score": "87",
  "pros": "Versatile for different activities; Breezy upper; Comfy interior padding; Smooth and pleasant ride; Great stability; Lightweight; Affordable for being a Hoka",
  "cons": "Too firm for some; Narrow toebox; Lacks cushioning for longer runs",
  "RR_verdict": "The Solimar is a completely new shoe from Hoka, and a different one, given that it sits at the intersection of different sports—just like the Hoka Kawana. We found it to be a compelling hybrid that can easily switch from a gym session to a 10K run on the road, or even just a walk in the city. It’s partly made with recycled materials and considering that it’s a Hoka, even the relatively low price tag is unusual and very welcome.",
