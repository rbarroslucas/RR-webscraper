  "RR_verdict": "The Reebok Zig Dynamica 4 is a daily trainer with a unique design and an attractive price tag. It's equipped with firm foam, which might not suit every runner's taste, but we were impressed by its surprisingly stable ride, outperforming many pricier options in its category. At just $85, it offers great value, but it's important to note its considerable heft and limited energy return. We think it's a solid pick for casual runners, but it might fall short for those in serious training. In our opinion, while it's a heavy shoe, its stability and affordability make it a worthy contender in the budget-friendly shoe market.",
