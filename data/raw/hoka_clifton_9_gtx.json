  "brand": "HOKA",
  "total_score": "88",
  "pros": "Exceptionally cushioned; Comfortable and long-lasting upper; Ideal for winter conditions; Only $15 more expensive than the non-waterproof Clifton; Still remarkably lightweight even with Gore-Tex; Excellent for easy and moderate-paced runs; Incredibly stable for neutral runners; Ultra-durable Durabrasion outsole",
  "cons": "May be too narrow for many; Heel-to-toe drop significantly differs from Hoka's claims; Really stiff heel counter for being a daily trainer; It needs more grip in wet surface",
  "RR_verdict": "In our view, Hoka has really nailed it with the Clifton 9 GTX, expertly waterproofing it while retaining the beloved features of the original version. It's still a lightweight daily trainer offering top-notch stability for neutral runners and a cushioned ride, all wrapped up in a comfortable-yet-durable upper. However, it's still tailored towards a performance fit, which may not be ideal for those with wide feet. Based on our experience, if you're looking for a waterproof running shoe mainly for road running, with the occasional gravel foray, this is a fantastic choice.",
