  "brand": "ASICS",
  "total_score": "89",
  "pros": "More foam than ever!; Plush and durable upper; Wide midsole enhances stability; Smooth, natural transitions; Semi-gusseted tongue improves lockdown; Reasonably priced; Keeps the same weight; Soft-landing FluidRide EVA outsole",
  "cons": "Breathability needs improvement; Outsole durability concerns; Lacks energy return; Toebox should be roomier",
  "RR_verdict": "The Gel Cumulus 27 receives another minor update as it approaches its 30th edition—a milestone that’s clearly no accident. It offers a versatile, stable, comfort-first ride with a reasonable price that many runners will appreciate. In our tests, we found it smooth and consistent underfoot, ideal for everyday runs. That said, we think the next version needs major airflow improvements and a slightly roomier toebox.",
