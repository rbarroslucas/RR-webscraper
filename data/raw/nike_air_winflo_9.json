  "pros": "Comfortable, soft ride; Excellent padding; Breathable upper; Grippy and durable outsole; Secure fit; Budget-friendly; Doubles as a gym shoe",
  "cons": "Not very responsive; Upper and midsole feel cheap",
  "RR_verdict": "The Nike Air Winflo comes back with its 9th edition and we found it to be a worthy update. Now with a better upper, softer midsole, and more precise fit, it confirms to be an honest daily trainer for beginners. With its attractive price point, it’s perfect for those looking for an affordable alternative to the (many) expensive shoes on the market.",
