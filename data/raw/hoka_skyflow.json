  "pros": "Great all-around performance; Enhanced midsole; Versatile across multiple distances; Solid stability; Durable construction; Breathable and comfortable upper; Secure lockdown",
  "cons": "Limited flex; Could be a bit lighter; Not the best for walking",
  "RR_verdict": "We found the Hoka Skyflow to be a well-rounded daily trainer that performs admirably across the board—durability, cushioning, stability, comfort, and value. While we think it’s a bit stiffer than we’d prefer, it’s a fantastic debut for this new series. In our view, it’s a good pick for runners seeking more foam underfoot compared to the Mach and Clifton, offering a great balance of features for a variety of runs.",
