  "RR_verdict": "A tempo trainer and a race day shoe? Take both in the Endorphin Speed 2. After pacing it through, this shoe proved itself a star in speed, responsiveness, and durability. It literally sends me flying through the blocks! Even better, it's unlike any speed-oriented shoe I have tested - it doesn't forgo comfort in favor of lightness and agility!",
