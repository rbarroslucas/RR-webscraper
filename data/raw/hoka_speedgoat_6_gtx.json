  "total_score": "72",
  "pros": "Built-to-last durability; Reliable Vibram traction; Winter-ready waterproof protection; Lightweight Gore-Tex membrane; Smooth rockered ride; Cushioned for long runs; Stability improvements; Secure lockdown; Fair price jump for waterproof upgrade",
  "cons": "Zero breathability; Tapered toebox; Probably too stiff; Not ideal for heel strikers",
  "RR_verdict": "The Speedgoat 6 GTX delivers exactly what we expected—a winter-ready version of the Speedgoat 6 with added waterproofing and durability. In our lab tests, we found that HOKA made smart, subtle refinements while keeping the shoe’s amazing traction, superb stability, and firm-yet-protective cushioning intact. The weight increase is barely noticeable, making it an easy transition for Speedgoat fans. However, in our experience, the shoe became noticeably stiffer, and the aggressively tapered toebox left us wanting more room.",
