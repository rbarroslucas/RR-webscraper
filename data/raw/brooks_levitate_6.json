  "RR_verdict": "The Brooks Levitate 6 might be a little too heavy to hover, but it sure can bounce! The shoe’s updated DNA Loft midsole provides us with a responsive and springy ride that feels peppy and protective over any distance. It also delivers even more comfort than we've come to expect from daily trainers; whether out for easy recovery days or gritting our teeth through long-haul efforts. What’s more, with an incredibly consistent performance in our freezer tests, the Levitate 6 is truly a shoe for all seasons!",
