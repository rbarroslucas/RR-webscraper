  "total_score": "89",
  "pros": "Exceptionally roomy toebox; Good transition shoe towards zero drop; Ultra-plush tongue for top comfort; Well cushioned for long adventures; Versatile for hiking and running; Good stability for heel strikers; All-around durability; Compatible with external gaiters; Reasonable price",
  "cons": "Midsole lacks energy return; Low heel collar allows debris in; Non-gusseted tongue; Not for narrow feet",
  "RR_verdict": "The Experience Wild marks a bold step for Altra, blending its signature foot-shaped toebox with a more accessible low-drop design. We tested it extensively and found that its roomy fit, plush tongue, and stable platform make it a solid option for runners seeking comfort on the trails. While the midsole lacks the responsiveness of cutting-edge foams, and the heel collar sits noticeably low, we believe this is a smart move—keeping Altra's signature feel while tapping into a new market and drawing in new customers (and fresh money) to the brand.",
