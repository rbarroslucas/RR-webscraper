  "total_score": "83",
  "pros": "Exceptional value; Durable design; Excellent stability; Superb weight reduction; Upgraded FlyteFoam midsole; Superb comfort; Versatile for multiple activities; Better than ever for long runs; Improved for heel strikers",
  "cons": "Breathability; Outsole needs more grip; Rigid heel counter",
  "RR_verdict": "The ASICS Gel Pulse 15 is a standout update, shedding two ounces and featuring an upgraded FlyteFoam midsole, a higher stack height, and remarkable stability—all at a surprisingly affordable price. Based on our lab tests, even though it lacks some grip and outsole coverage, the combination of features in the Gel Pulse 15 places it among the top budget-friendly shoes we've ever evaluated.",
