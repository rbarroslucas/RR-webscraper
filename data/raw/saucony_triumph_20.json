  "pros": "It's now livelier; Comfy as expected; Fits like a glove!; Heel clutch couldn't be better; No lace bites; ...and they stay in place; Lighter than before; Plush yet breezy upper",
  "cons": "Price is way up there; Rocker geometry isn't as pronounced",
  "RR_verdict": "The Triumph 20 from Saucony is a daily running shoe that brings back the roots of the OG Triumph. We felt as if the Triumph strayed away from its identity in the past two versions but now it's back, and it's better than ever! The shoe is more cushioned and has some nice bounce to offer. If you want a leg-saving ride that will keep you feeling excited, we cannot recommend the Saucony Triumph 20 enough!",
