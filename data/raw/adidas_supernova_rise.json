  "pros": "Stable ride; Ideal for heel strikers; Smooth heel bevel; Plush, cozy upper; Breathable and durable; Finally new PEBA foam; Excellent value at $140; Toebox offers exceptional width and height",
  "cons": "No Continental rubber; Tongue lacks gusset; Limited energy return",
  "RR_verdict": "The Adidas Supernova Rise marks an exciting evolution in their daily trainer lineup, maintaining the series' core characteristics while introducing some notable enhancements. In our experience, it shines as a durable, comfortable, and stable shoe, particularly catering to heel strikers. It's lighter than ever, boasts a more generous toebox, and presents excellent value at $140. However, our tests revealed that the new PEBA foam didn't quite deliver the expected responsiveness, and the move away from Continental rubber in the outsole could be a big letdown for some enthusiasts.",
