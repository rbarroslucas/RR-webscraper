  "brand": "New Balance",
  "total_score": "87",
  "pros": "Exceptional all-around comfort; Ultra-plush cushioning; Ideal for slow long runs; Great cushion-to-price ratio; Remarkable stability for its size; Superb lockdown; Durable and high-grip outsole; Well-designed rocker geometry; Lots of improvements from v4",
  "cons": "Heavier than its predecessor; Snug fit; Maybe even too plush!; A bit stiff for casual wear",
  "RR_verdict": "The New Balance Fresh Foam X More v5 has an endless name matched by its endless cushioning, finally making it a true maximalist running shoe. We were impressed by its eye-popping design that not only accommodates its size but also enhances stability despite its ultra-plush midsole. We also liked its comfortable upper during our runs. On the downside, the foam offered low energy return, and we noticed that the toebox was overly tapered and needs more volume.",
