  "RR_verdict": "The Salomon Sense Ride 4 is a surefire winner in the trail running scene! I discovered that it's a beast that has an INSANE grip, loads of underfoot protection, and a fun, lively ride. Now, that's a combo you don't get every day from a dedicated trail shoe! It can eat up anything I throw at it, for sure, but where it shines is during steep climbs, telling me so much of its ground-digging traction!",
