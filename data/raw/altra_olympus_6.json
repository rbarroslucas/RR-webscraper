  "RR_verdict": "The Altra Olympus 6 left us with a bittersweet taste—while the updates are solid, it feels like it could have been truly exceptional with just a few key tweaks. We were impressed by the state-of-the-art upper, offering second-to-none durability and breathability, paired with a real zero-drop geometry and a grippy Vibram Megagrip outsole. However, the heavy weight, minor price hike, and low-rebound CMEVA foam left us wondering what this shoe could have been but ultimately isn’t.",
