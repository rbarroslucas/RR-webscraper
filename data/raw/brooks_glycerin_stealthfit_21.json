  "brand": "Brooks",
  "total_score": "84",
  "pros": "Durable outsole; Sock-like tongue; Significant weight reduction; Comfortable fit; Great for long runs; Improved heel counter; Supercritical foam",
  "cons": "Needs more breathability; Lacks energy return",
  "RR_verdict": "During our lab evaluation, the StealthFit edition emerged as a remarkable variant of the regular Glycerin 21, showcasing a significant weight reduction and a snug, sock-like upper. Although it compromises somewhat on breathability and cushioning, we believe these trade-offs are justified for many runners. For us, this variant excels as a featherweight daily runner, impressing us with its comfort and durability across a variety of terrains.",
