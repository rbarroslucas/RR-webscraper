  "cons": "Not for wide feet; Durability is not great",
  "RR_verdict": "With a significant update from the previous iteration, the New Balance Fresh Foam Roav v2 is now a much better daily trainer, in our opinion. It scored very well in the weight department and does even better when it comes to the price, which is really one of the lowest around. We believe that it’s best suited for short runs, yet it’s not limited to that. We found it an excellent choice for gym workouts and even an appealing sneaker for the city.",
