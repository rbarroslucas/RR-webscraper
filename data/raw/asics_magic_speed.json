  "cons": "Not for wide feet; Not built for comfort",
  "RR_verdict": "If you're new to the world of carbon-plated running shoes, I think you should give the ASICS Magic Speed some serious thought. It's a plated tempo-day speedster that I've noticed serves as a training complement to the MetaSpeed Sky. But if you want a full-on racing shoe, this can fit the bill too! Its ride is just so efficient and peppy, I don't even have to put much effort into it to go fast.",
