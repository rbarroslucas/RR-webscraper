  "cons": "Much higher heel drop than expected; Average at best breathability; Upper lacks durability; Feels different depending on weather",
  "RR_verdict": "If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it seems to be the ethos behind Brooks’ update to the Hyperion Tempo, which was simplistically redubbed as the Hyperion. Apart from the name, we discovered that not much has really changed as the shoe keeps all the features that made its predecessor a simple yet exceptional tempo trainer, with only some minor (sometimes barely noticeable) tweaks here and there. We love how this speedy shoe isn’t dependent on newfangled technology in order to pick up the pace. It also delivers a traditional ride that feels fast, responsive, and comfortable underfoot.",
