  "brand": "Skechers",
  "total_score": "84",
  "pros": "Well cushioned; Softly padded, comfortable upper; Lightweight for its generous stack height; Machine washable; Great value; Ideal for heel strikers; Doubles as a walking shoe; Premium, plush insole",
  "cons": "Only for narrow feet; Lacks energy return; Limited forefoot stability; Poor ventilation",
  "RR_verdict": "The Skechers Max Cushioning Elite 2.0 is a superb choice for narrow-footed runners looking for a versatile, comfort-focused, and reasonably priced option for both running and walking. In our lab tests, we found it offers substantial cushioning and a cozy upper that feels fantastic during all-day wear. However, its narrow fit significantly limits its appeal for those with wider feet or who prefer a roomier toebox.",
