  "cons": "Expensive; No gaiter attachments",
  "RR_verdict": "If you tried the original Fuga EX 2, the BOA version will get you even more hooked! Amazingly well-cushioned and supportive, this trail shoe made me want to run longer. I believe that it could be your daily driver or a race shoe at any distance. The EX BOA packs lots of functional features that justify its above-average price point.",
