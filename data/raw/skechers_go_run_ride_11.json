  "total_score": "92",
  "pros": "Well-cushioned and comfortable; Lively and bouncy midsole; Carbon-infused H-plate feels responsive; Propulsive rocker geometry; Good for long distances; Generously padded and forgiving upper; Feels like a premium shoe; Great price per performance",
  "cons": "Heavier than average; Not ideal for wide feet; Questionable upper durability; Finnicky rearfoot lockdown",
  "RR_verdict": "The Go Run Ride 11 is an unassuming offering from Skechers that comes packed with features that make it an excellent addition to any runner's rotation regardless of experience level. From the Goodyear rubber outsole to the supercritical Hyperburst Ice midsole foam, as well as the patented Skechers arch support system, the GRR 11 feels much more like a premium running shoe than its $125 price stage would suggest. We couldn't get enough of testing this daily trainer that brought lots of comfort and fun to our test runs.",
