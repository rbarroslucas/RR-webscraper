  "RR_verdict": "Having tested Kinvaras of the past, I am happy to report that the Kinvara 12 continues to be a delight on the feet as a lightweight daily trainer. So much so that I even forgot I had shoes on! Like all other do-it-all shoes, it's good at everything and great at nothing (not a bad thing). For $110, it's a solid choice for a shoe that performs on slow runs, long-distance efforts, tempo sessions, and everything in between!",
