  "pros": "Great for wide feet; Solid stability; Fantastic heel lockdown; Grippy outsole; Energy Blade boost forefoot propulsion; Works well for heel strikers; Agile ride",
  "cons": "Outsole lacks durability; Noticeable heavy for a tempo trainer; High price; Limited energy return",
  "RR_verdict": "The Salomon Phantasm 2 primarily targets heel strikers with wide feet who are looking for a comfort-focused fit, but in our testing, we found it fell short in several areas. Its notably hefty weight, lackluster energy return, and fragile outsole became apparent during use, limiting its effectiveness as a tempo training shoe. While the upper offers a cozy fit and an excellent heel lockdown, we believe its high premium price is tough to justify given these shortcomings.",
