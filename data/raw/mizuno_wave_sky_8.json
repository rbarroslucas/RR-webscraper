  "total_score": "91",
  "pros": "Reduced weight from v7; Softer, responsive midsole; All-around comfort; Ideal for long-distance runs; Perfect for heel strikers; Maximalist yet lightweight design; High-quality upper; Great for winter",
  "cons": "Needs better breathability; Not very stable; Fast-wearing outsole; Price may deter some",
  "RR_verdict": "Mizuno enjoys standing out with unique designs, and the Wave Sky 8 follows that trend. We were struck by its unique bubble-like midsole design, now enhanced with a new foam that keeps it light yet bouncy. With a stack height of over 40 mm, it’s built for endurance but we've noted some concerns about stability and breathability in the upper. Nevertheless, it's a good option in the premium daily trainer category and marks a significant upgrade from its predecessor.",
