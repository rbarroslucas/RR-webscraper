  "brand": "ASICS",
  "total_score": "80",
  "pros": "Well-cushioned and comfortable; Generously padded interior; Great for easy runs and recovery days; Flexible and forgiving on the foot; Reliable traction; Secure lockdown; Accommodating toebox; Feels decently stable; Good for cold winter runs; Works well as a gym/walking shoe; Lots of colorway options",
  "cons": "Average breathability at best; Could be lighter; Not ideal for forefoot strikers; Midsole lacks responsiveness",
  "RR_verdict": "Like its previous iteration, the ASICS Gel Pulse 14 is a comfort-oriented daily trainer that feels way more premium underfoot than its wallet-friendly price might suggest. While it may not be the best choice for high-intensity sessions, the shoe's AMPLIFOAM midsole and cushy padding effectively babied during our easier test runs, walks, and even gym days. Moreover, we were impressed by its incredibly consistent performance in our freezer tests which make the shoe a great year-round training partner.",
