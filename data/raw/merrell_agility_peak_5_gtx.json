  "brand": "Merrell",
  "total_score": "80",
  "pros": "True waterproof protection; Grippy, trail-ready Vibram outsole; Perfect for cold, wet climates; Can handle some challenging conditions; Stable yet cushioned heel; Improved for hiking and walking; Well-designed outsole lugs; Great build quality; Keeps feet warm; Rock plate",
  "cons": "Narrow toebox; Heel padding durability concerns; No reflective elements; Drop differs too much from stated",
  "RR_verdict": "The Merrell Agility Peak 5 GTX overcomes the common drawbacks of Gore-Tex variants—it gained minimal weight, maintained comfort, and even improved flexibility. In our lab tests, it performed wonderfully as a winter-ready trail companion. With its waterproof upper and grippy Vibram Megagrip outsole, we believe it’s an outstanding choice for runners seeking a narrow-toebox shoe that performs well in harsh, wet conditions.",
