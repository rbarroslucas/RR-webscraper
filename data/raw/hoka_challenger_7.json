  "total_score": "85",
  "pros": "Lighter than before; Effective lockdown; Stable and smooth ride; Superior comfort; Plenty protective underfoot; Excellent feel on roads; Grippy on most surfaces; Doubles as a walking shoe",
  "cons": "Ride lacks excitement; Not durable outsole; Greater-than-expected drop; Narrow toebox",
  "RR_verdict": "It dropped “ATR” in the name but the Challenger 7 is still an all-terrain shoe that impressed us with how well it handled both trails and roads. Comfort and protection are next-level in this Hoka shoe, and by dropping some weight it has now what it takes to deliver a very enjoyable ride. It’s not a speedster, but when it comes to cruising for miles and miles, even whole days out, it’s a superb choice.",
