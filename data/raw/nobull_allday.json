  "pros": "A fun and lively ride; Stable throughout; Very light; Breathable on warm days; Also great for gym and walking; Awesome fit for narrow feet; Grippy on any surface; Outsole is super durable",

  "RR_verdict": "We believe that the Allday from NOBULL (previously known as NOBULL Ripstop Runner) is a daily trainer that's ideal for running newbies and casual runners alike. Although very stable and supportive, it doesn't feel flat. The shoe also has some bounce to it, making the ride fun. This NOBULL shoe doesn't disappoint us in the weight department either!",
