  "cons": "Limited stability; Not the best energy return; Narrow fit",
  "RR_verdict": "The ASICS Magic Speed 4 marks a significant overhaul, featuring enhanced cushioning and a carbon plate as its standout elements. We really liked the additional energy return from FF Turbo and the durable outsole that offer great value at a reasonable price. However, we've found in the lab that the increased weight and poor stability make it a selective choice—not suitable for every runner.",
